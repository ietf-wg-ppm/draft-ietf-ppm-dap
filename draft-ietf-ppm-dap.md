--- abstract

There are many situations in which it is desirable to take measurements of data
which people consider sensitive. In these cases, the entity taking the
measurement is usually not interested in people's individual responses but
rather in aggregated data. Conventional methods require collecting individual
responses and then aggregating them on some server, thus representing a threat
to user privacy and rendering many such measurements difficult and impractical.
This document describes a multi-party distributed aggregation protocol (DAP) for
privacy preserving measurement (PPM) which can be used to collect aggregate data
without revealing any individual contributor's data.

# Introduction

This document describes the Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP) for privacy
preserving measurement. The protocol is executed by a large set of clients and two
aggregation servers. The aggregators' goal is to compute some aggregate
statistic over measurements generated by clients without learning the
measurements themselves. This is made possible by distributing the computation
among the aggregators in such a way that, as long as at least one of them
executes the protocol honestly, no measurement is ever seen in the clear by any
aggregator.

## Change Log

(RFC EDITOR: Remove this section.)

(\*) Indicates a change that breaks wire compatibility with the previous draft.

14:

- Enforce VDAF aggregation parameter validity. This is not relevant for Prio3,
  which requires only that reports be aggregated at most once. It is relevant
  for VDAFs for which validity depends on how many times a report might be
  aggregated (at most once in DAP). (\*)

- Require all timestamps to be truncated by `time_precision`. (\*)

- Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-13 to 14 {{!VDAF}}. There are no functional or
  breaking changes in this draft.

- Clarify conditions for rejecting reports based on the report metadata,
  including the timestamp and public and private extensions.

- Clarify that the Helper responds with 202 Accepted to an aggregation
  continuation request.

- Bump version tag from "dap-13" to "dap-14". (\*)

13:

- Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-12 to 13 {{!VDAF}} and adopt the streaming
  aggregation interface. Accordingly, clarify that DAP is only compatible with
  VDAFs for which aggregation is order insensitive.

- Add public extensions to report metadata. (\*)

- Improve extension points for batch modes. (\*)

- During the upload interaction, allow the Leader to indicate to the Client which
  set of report extensions it doesn't support.

- Add a start time to task parameters and require rejection of reports outside
  of the time validity window. Incidentally, replace the task end time with a
  task duration parameter.

- Clarify underspecified behavior around aggregation skew recovery.

- Improve IANA considerations and add guidelines for extending DAP.

- Rename "upload extension" to "report extension", and "prepare error" to
  "report error", to better align the names of these types with their
  functionality.

- Bump version tag from "dap-12" to "dap-13". (\*)

12:

- Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-08 to 12 {{!VDAF}}, and specify the newly-defined
  application context string to be a concatenation of the DAP version in use
  with the task ID. (\*)

- Add support for "asynchronous" aggregation, based on the Leader polling the
  Helper for the result of each step of aggregation. (\*)

- Update collection semantics to match the new aggregation semantics introduced
  in support of asynchronous aggregation. (\*)

- Clarify the requirements around report replay protection, defining when and
  how report IDs must be checked and stored in order to correctly detect
  replays.

- Remove support for per-task HPKE configurations. (\*)

- Rename "query type" to "batch mode", to align the name of this configuration
  value with its functionality.

- Rename the "fixed-size" batch mode to "leader-selected", to align the name
  with the behavior of this query type.

- Remove the `max_batch_size` parameter of the "fixed-size" batch mode.

- Restore the `part_batch_selector` field of the `Collection` structure, which
  was removed in draft 11, as it is required to decrypt collection results in
  some cases. (\*)

- Update `PrepareError` allocations in order to remove an unused value and to
  reserve the zero value for testing. (\*)

- Document distributed-system and synchronization concerns in the operational
  considerations section.

- Document additional storage and runtime requirements in the operational
  considerations section.

- Document deviations from the presentation language of {{Section 3 of
  !RFC8446}} for structures described in this specification.

- Clarify that differential privacy mitigations can help with privacy, rather
  than robustness, in the operational considerations section.

- Bump version tag from "dap-11" to "dap-12". (\*)

11:

- Remove support for multi-collection of batches, as well as the fixed-size
  query type's `by_batch_id` query. (\*)

- Clarify purpose of report ID uniqueness.

- Bump version tag from "dap-10" to "dap-11". (\*)

10:

- Editorial changes from httpdir early review.

- Poll collection jobs with HTTP GET instead of POST. (\*)

- Upload reports with HTTP POST instead of PUT. (\*)

- Clarify requirements for problem documents.

- Provide guidance on batch sizes when running VDAFs with non-trivial
  aggregation parameters.

- Bump version tag from "dap-09" to "dap-10". (\*)

09:

- Fixed-size queries: make the maximum batch size optional.

- Fixed-size queries: require current-batch queries to return distinct batches.

- Clarify requirements for compatible VDAFs.

- Clarify rules around creating and abandoning aggregation jobs.

- Recommend that all task parameters are visible to all parties.

- Revise security considerations section.

- Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-07 to 08 {{!VDAF}}. (\*)

- Bump version tag from "dap-07" to "dap-09". (\*)

08:

- Clarify requirements for initializing aggregation jobs.

- Add more considerations for Sybil attacks.

- Expand guidance around choosing the VDAF verification key.

- Add an error type registry for the aggregation sub-protocol.

07:

- Bump version tag from "dap-06" to "dap-07". This is a bug-fix revision: the
  editors overlooked some changes we intended to pick up in the previous
  version. (\*)

06:

- Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-06 to 07 {{!VDAF}}. (\*)

- Overhaul security considerations (#488).

- Adopt revised ping-pong interface in draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-07 (#494).

- Add aggregation parameter to `AggregateShareAad` (#498). (\*)

- Bump version tag from "dap-05" to "dap-06". (\*)

05:

- Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-05 to 06 {{!VDAF}}. (\*)

- Specialize the protocol for two-party VDAFs (i.e., one Leader and One
  Helper). Accordingly, update the aggregation sub-protocol to use the new
  "ping-pong" interface for two-party VDAFs introduced in
  draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-06. (\*)

- Allow the following actions to be safely retried: aggregation job creation,
  collection job creation, and requesting the Helper's aggregate share.

- Merge error types that are related.

- Drop recommendation to generate IDs using a cryptographically secure
  pseudorandom number generator wherever pseudorandomness is not required.

- Require HPKE config identifiers to be unique.

- Bump version tag from "dap-04" to "dap-05". (\*)

04:

- Introduce resource oriented HTTP API. (#278, #398, #400) (\*)

- Clarify security requirements for choosing VDAF verify key. (#407, #411)

- Require Clients to provide nonce and random input when sharding inputs. (#394,
  #425) (\*)

- Add interval of time spanned by constituent reports to Collection message.
  (#397, #403) (\*)

- Update share validation requirements based on latest security analysis. (#408,
  #410)

- Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-03 to 05 {{!VDAF}}. (#429) (\*)

- Bump version tag from "dap-03" to "dap-04". (#424) (\*)

03:

- Enrich the "fixed_size" query type to allow the Collector to request a
  recently aggregated batch without knowing the batch ID in advance. ID
  discovery was previously done out-of-band. (\*)

- Allow Aggregators to advertise multiple HPKE configurations. (\*)

- Clarify requirements for enforcing anti-replay. Namely, while it is sufficient
  to detect repeated report IDs, it is also enough to detect repeated IDs and
  timestamps.

- Remove the extensions from the Report and add extensions to the plaintext
  payload of each ReportShare. (\*)

- Clarify that extensions are mandatory to implement: If an Aggregator does not
  recognize a ReportShare's extension, it must reject it.

- Clarify that Aggregators must reject any ReportShare with repeated extension
  types.

- Specify explicitly how to serialize the Additional Authenticated Data (AAD)
  string for HPKE encryption. This clarifies an ambiguity in the previous
  version. (\*)

- Change the length tag for the aggregation parameter to 32 bits. (\*)

- Use the same prefix ("application") for all media types. (\*)

- Make input share validation more explicit, including adding a new
  ReportShareError variant, "report_too_early", for handling reports too far in
  the future. (\*)

- Improve alignment of problem details usage with {{!RFC7807}}. Replace
  "reportTooLate" problem document type with "repjortRejected" and clarify
  handling of rejected reports in the upload sub-protocol. (\*)

- Bump version tag from "dap-02" to "dap-03". (\*)

02:

- Define a new task configuration parameter, called the "query type", that
  allows tasks to partition reports into batches in different ways. In the
  current draft, the Collector specifies a "query", which the Aggregators use to
  guide selection of the batch. Two query types are defined: the "time_interval"
  type captures the semantics of draft 01; and the "fixed_size" type allows the
  Leader to partition the reports arbitrarily, subject to the constraint that
  each batch is roughly the same size. (\*)

- Define a new task configuration parameter, called the task "expiration", that
  defines the lifetime of a given task.

- Specify requirements for HTTP request authentication rather than a concrete
  scheme. (Draft 01 required the use of the `DAP-Auth-Token` header; this is now
  optional.)

- Make "task_id" an optional parameter of the "/hpke_config" endpoint.

- Add report count to CollectResp message. (\*)

- Increase message payload sizes to accommodate VDAFs with input and aggregate
  shares larger than 2^16-1 bytes. (\*)

- Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-01 to 03 {{!VDAF}}. (\*)

- Bump version tag from "dap-01" to "dap-02". (\*)

- Rename the report nonce to the "report ID" and move it to the top of the
  structure. (\*)

- Clarify when it is safe for an Aggregator to evict various data artifacts from
  long-term storage.

# Overview {#overview}

The protocol is executed by a large set of Clients and a pair of servers
referred to as "Aggregators". Each Client's input to the protocol is its
measurement (or set of measurements, e.g., counts of some user behavior). Given
the input set of measurements `meas_1, ..., meas_N` held by the Clients, and an
"aggregation parameter" `agg_param` shared by the Aggregators, the goal of DAP
is to compute `agg_result = F(agg_param, meas_1, ..., meas_N)` for some
function `F` while revealing nothing else about the measurements. We call `F`
the "aggregation function" and `agg_result` the "aggregate result".

DAP is extensible in that it allows for the addition of new cryptographic
schemes that compute different aggregation functions. In particular, the
aggregation function is determined by the Verifiable Distributed Aggregation
Function, or VDAF {{!VDAF=I-D.draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-14}}, used to securely
compute it.

VDAFs rely on secret sharing to protect the privacy of the measurements. Rather
than sending its measurement in the clear, each Client shards its measurement
into a pair of "input shares" and sends an input share to each of the
Aggregators. This scheme has two important properties:

* Given only one of the input shares, it is impossible to deduce the plaintext
  measurement from which it was generated.

* Aggregators can compute secret shares of the aggregate result by aggregating
  their shares locally into "aggregate shares", which may later be combined
  into the aggregate result.

Note that some VDAFs allow measurements to be aggregated multiple times, each
time with a different aggregation parameter; however, DAP only allows each
measurement to be aggregated once. Similarly, some VDAFs produce aggregate
values which depend on the order in which the measurements are aggregated;
however, DAP only supports VDAFs whose aggregation results are independent of
the order in which measurements are aggregated (see {{Section 4.4.1 of !VDAF}}).

## System Architecture {#system-architecture}

The overall system architecture is shown in {{dap-topology}}.

{: #dap-topology title="DAP architecture"}

The main participants in the protocol are as follows:

Collector:
: The party which wants to obtain the aggregate result over the measurements
  generated by the Clients. A task will have a single Collector.

Clients:
: The parties which take the measurements and report them to the Aggregators.
  In order to provide reasonable levels of privacy, there must be a large number
  of Clients.

Leader:
: The Aggregator responsible for coordinating the protocol. It receives the
  reports from Clients, aggregates them with the assistance of the Helper, and
  it orchestrates the process of computing the aggregate result as requested by
  the Collector. Each task has a single Leader.

Helper:
: The Aggregator assisting the Leader with the computation. The protocol is
  designed so that the Helper is relatively lightweight, with most of the
  operational burden borne by the Leader. Each task has a single Helper.

{:br}

{{dap-topology}} illustrates which participants exchange HTTP messages. Arrows
go from HTTP clients to HTTP servers. Note that some DAP participants may be
clients sometimes but servers at other times. It is even possible for a single
entity to embody multiple participants. For example, the Collector could also
be one of the Aggregators.

In the course of a measurement task ({{task-configuration}}), each Client
records its own measurement value(s), packages them up into a report, and sends
them to the Leader. Each share is encrypted one of the two Aggregators so that
even though they pass through the Leader, the Leader is unable to see or modify
the Helper's share. Depending on the task, the Client may only send one report
or may send many reports over time.

The Leader distributes the shares to the Helper and orchestrates the process of
verifying them (see {{validating-inputs}}) and assembling them into an aggregate
result for the Collector. Depending on the VDAF, it may be possible to
incrementally process each report as it is uploaded, or it may be necessary to
wait until the Collector transmits a collection request before processing can
begin.

## Validating Measurements {#validating-inputs}

An essential task of any data collection pipeline is ensuring that the data
being aggregated is "valid". For example, each measurement might be expected to
be a number between `0` and `10`. In DAP, input validation is complicated by the
fact that none of the entities other than the Client ever sees that Client's
plaintext measurement. To an Aggregator, a secret share of a valid measurement
is indistinguishable from a secret share of an invalid measurement.

In DAP, input validation is accomplished by an interactive computation between
the Leader and Helper. At the beginning of this computation, each Aggregator is
in possession of an input share uploaded by the Client. At the end of the
computation, each Aggregator is in possession of either an "output share" that
is ready to be aggregated or an indication that the underlying data is invalid,
in which case the report is rejected.

This process is known as "preparation" and is specified by the VDAF itself
({{Section 5.2 of !VDAF}}). To facilitate preparation, the report generated by
the Client include information used by the Aggregators. For example, Prio3
({{Section 7 of !VDAF}}) includes a zero-knowledge proof of the measurement's
validity ({{Section 7.1 of !VDAF}}); the process of verifying this proof
reveals nothing about the underlying measurement beyond its validity.

The specific properties attested to by the proof vary depending on the
measurement being taken. For instance, to measure the time the user took
performing a given task the proof might demonstrate that the value reported was
within a certain range (e.g., between `0` and `60` seconds). By contrast, to
report which of a set of `N` options the user select, the report might contain
`N` integers and the proof would demonstrate that `N-1` were `0` and the other
was `1`.

It is important to recognize that "validity" is distinct from "correctness".
For instance, the user might have spent `30` seconds on a task but the Client
might report `60` seconds. This is a problem with any measurement system and
DAP does not attempt to address it; it merely ensures that the data is within
acceptable limits, so the Client could not report `10^6`  or `-20` seconds.

## Replay Protection {#replay-protection}

Another goal of DAP is to mitigate replay attacks in which a report is
aggregated multiple times within a batch or across multiple batches. This would
allow the attacker to learn more information about the underlying measurement
than it would otherwise.

When a Client generates a report, it also generates a random nonce, called the
"report ID". Each Aggregator is responsible for storing the IDs of reports it
has aggregated for a given task. To check whether a report has been replayed,
it checks whether the report's ID is in the set of stored IDs.

Note that IDs do not need to be stored indefinitely. The protocol allows
Aggregators to enforce replay only for a sliding time window (e.g., within the
last two weeks of the current time) and reject reports that fall outside of the
replay window. This allows implementation to save resources by forgetting old
report IDs.

## Lifecycle of Protocol Objects

The following diagram illustrates how the various objects in the protocol are
constructed or transformed into other protocol objects. Nodes enclosed in an
oval are verbs or actions which process, transform or combine one or more
objects into one or more other objects. Note that this does not necessarily
illustrate how participants communicate. In particular, the processing of
aggregation jobs happens in distinct, non-colluding parties.

### Arity of Protocol Objects

DAP reports are 1 to 1 to with measurements. In this illustration, `i` distinct
Clients upload a distinct report, but a single Client could upload multiple
reports to a task (see {{sybil}} for some implications of this). The process of
sharding measurements, constructing reports and uploading them is specified in
{{upload-flow}}.

Reports are many to 1 with aggregation jobs. The Leader assigns each of the `i`
reports into one of `j` different aggregation jobs, which can be run in parallel
by the Aggregators. Each aggregation job contains `k` reports. `k` is roughly
`i / j`, but it is not necessary for aggregation jobs to have uniform size. See
{{operational-capabilities}} for some discussion of performance implications for
aggregation job scheduling strategies.

Report shares, input shares and output shares have a 1 to 1 to 1 relationship.
Report shares are decrypted into input shares and then prepared into output
shares. The scheduling of aggregation jobs and their execution by the
Aggregators is specified in {{aggregate-flow}}.

Output shares are accumulated into batch buckets, and so have a many to 1
relationship. In this example, we show one batch bucket for each aggregation
job, but aggregation jobs and batch buckets are not necessarily 1 to 1. Multiple
aggregation jobs could contribute to the same batch bucket, and a single
aggregation job could contribute to multiple batch buckets. The assignation of
output shares to batch buckets is specified in {{batch-buckets}}.

Using the Collector's query, each Aggregator will merge one or more batch
buckets together into its aggregate share, meaning batch buckets are many to 1
with aggregate shares.

The Leader and Helper's aggregate shares are finally delivered to the Collector
to be unsharded into the aggregate result. Since there are always exactly two
Aggregators in DAP, aggregate shares are 2 to 1 with aggregate results. The
collection interaction is specified in {{collect-flow}}.

There can be many aggregate results for a single task. The Collection process
may occur multiple times for each task, with the Collector obtaining multiple
aggregate results. For example, imagine a task where the Collector obtains
aggregate results once an hour, or every time 10,000,000 reports are uploaded.

# Message Transport {#message-transport}

Communications between DAP participants are carried over HTTP {{!RFC9110}}. Use
of HTTPS is REQUIRED to provide server authentication and confidentiality.

## Presentation Language

With some exceptions, we use the presentation language defined in {{!RFC8446,
Section 3}} to define messages in the DAP protocol. Encoding and decoding of
these messages as byte strings also follows {{RFC8446}}. We enumerate the
exceptions below.

### Variable-Length Vectors

{{Section 3.4 of !RFC8446}} describes a syntax for variable-length vectors where
a range of permitted lengths is provided. By convention, DAP always specifies
the lower length limit of variable-length vectors to be `0`.

### Structure Variants

{{Section 3.7 of !RFC8446}} defines a syntax for structure fields whose values
are constants. In this document, we do not use that notation, but use something
similar to describe specific variants of structures that use an enumerated type
as a discriminator, described in {{!RFC8446, Section 3.8}}.

For example, suppose we have an enumeration and a structure defined as follows:

~~~ tls-presentation
enum {
  number(0),
  string(1),
  (255)
} ExampleEnum;

struct {
  uint32 always_present;
  ExampleEnum type;
  select (ExampleStruct.type) {
    case number: uint32 a_number;
    case string: opaque a_string<0..10>;
  };
} ExampleStruct;
~~~

Then we describe the specific variant of `ExampleStruct` where `type == number`
with a `variant` block as follows:

~~~ tls-presentation
variant {
  /* Field exists regardless of variant */
  uint32 always_present;
  ExampleEnum type = number;
  /* Only fields included in the `type == number`
     variant are described */
  uint32 a_number;
} ExampleStruct;
~~~

The protocol text accompanying this would explain how implementations should
handle the `always_present` and `a_number` fields, but not the `type` field.
This does not mean that the `type` field of `ExampleStruct` can only ever have
value `number`; it means only that it has this type in this instance.

This notation can also be used in structures where the enum field is not used as
a discriminant. For example, given the following structure containing an
enumerator:

~~~ tls-presentation
enum {
  something(0),
  something_else(1),
  (255)
} FailureReason;

struct {
  FailureReason failure_reason;
  opaque another_field<0..256>;
} FailedOperation;
~~~

The protocol text might include a description like:

~~~ tls-presentation
variant {
  FailureReason failure_reason = something;
  opaque another_field<0..256>;
} FailedOperation;
~~~

## HTTPS Request Authentication {#request-authentication}

DAP is made up of several interactions in which different subsets of the
protocol's participants interact with each other.

In those cases where a channel between two participants is tunneled through
another protocol participant, DAP mandates the use of public-key encryption
using {{!HPKE=RFC9180}} to ensure that only the intended recipient can see a
message in the clear.

In other cases, DAP requires HTTP client authentication as well as server
authentication. Any authentication scheme that is composable with HTTP is
allowed. For example:

* {{?OAuth2=RFC6749}} credentials are presented in an Authorization HTTP header,
  which can be added to any DAP protocol message.

* TLS client certificates can be used to authenticate the underlying transport.

* The `DAP-Auth-Token` HTTP header described in
  {{?I-D.draft-dcook-ppm-dap-interop-test-design-04}}.

* {{?RFC9421}} HTTP message signatures authenticate messages without
  transmitting a secret.

This flexibility allows organizations deploying DAP to use existing well-known
HTTP authentication mechanisms that they already support. Discovering what
authentication mechanisms are supported by a DAP participant is outside of this
document's scope.

## Errors

Errors can be reported in DAP both as HTTP status codes and as problem detail
objects {{!RFC9457}} in the response body. For example, if the HTTP client sends
a request using a method not allowed in this document, then the server MAY
return HTTP status 405 Method Not Allowed.

When the server responds with an error status code, it SHOULD provide additional
information using a problem detail object. If the response body does consist of
a problem detail object, the HTTP status code MUST indicate a client or server
error (the 4xx or 5xx classes, respectively, from {{Section 15 of !RFC9110}}).

To facilitate automatic response to errors, this document defines the following
standard tokens for use in the "type" field:

| Type                        | Description                                                                                  |
|:----------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| invalidMessage              | A message received by a protocol participant could not be parsed or otherwise was invalid. |
| unrecognizedTask            | A server received a message with an unknown task ID. |
| unrecognizedAggregationJob  | A server received a message with an unknown aggregation job ID. |
| outdatedConfig              | The message was generated using an outdated configuration. |
| reportRejected              | Report could not be processed for an unspecified reason. |
| reportTooEarly              | Report could not be processed because its timestamp is too far in the future. |
| batchInvalid                | The batch boundary check for Collector's query failed. |
| invalidBatchSize            | There are an invalid number of reports in the batch. |
| invalidAggregationParameter | The aggregation parameter assigned to a batch is invalid. |
| batchMismatch               | Aggregators disagree on the report shares that were aggregated in a batch. |
| unauthorizedRequest         | Authentication of an HTTP request failed (see {{request-authentication}}). |
| stepMismatch                | The Aggregators disagree on the current step of the DAP aggregation protocol. |
| batchOverlap                | A request's query includes reports that were previously collected in a different batch. |
| unsupportedExtension        | An upload request's extensions list includes an unknown extension. |
{: #urn-space-errors title = "DAP errors"}

These types are scoped to the errors sub-namespace of the DAP URN namespace,
e.g., urn:ietf:params:ppm:dap:error:invalidMessage.

This list is not exhaustive. The server MAY return errors set to a URN other
than those defined above. Servers MUST NOT use the DAP URN namespace for errors
not listed in the appropriate IANA registry (see {{urn-space}}). The "detail"
member of the Problem Details document includes additional diagnostic
information.

When the task ID is known (see {{task-configuration}}), the problem document
SHOULD include an additional "taskid" member containing the ID encoded in Base
64 using the URL and filename safe alphabet with no padding defined in
{{Sections 5 and 3.2 of !RFC4648}}.

In the remainder of this document, the tokens in the table above are used to
refer to error types, rather than the full URNs. For example, an "error of type
'invalidMessage'" refers to an error document with "type" value
"urn:ietf:params:ppm:dap:error:invalidMessage".

This document uses the verbs "abort" and "alert with \[some error message\]" to
describe how protocol participants react to various error conditions. This
implies HTTP status code 400 Bad Request unless explicitly specified otherwise.

# Protocol Definition {#protocol}

DAP has three major interactions which need to be defined:

* Clients upload reports to the Aggregators, specified in {{upload-flow}}
* Aggregators jointly prepare reports and aggregate them together, specified in
  {{aggregate-flow}}
* The Collector collects aggregated results from the Aggregators, specified in
  {{collect-flow}}

Each of these interactions is defined in terms of "resources". In this section
we define these resources and the messages used to act on them.

## Basic Type Definitions {#basic-definitions}

The following are some basic type definitions used in other messages.

A `ReportID` is used to uniquely identify a report in the context of a DAP task.

~~~ tls-presentation
opaque ReportID[16];
~~~

`Role` enumerates the roles assumed by protocol participants.

~~~ tls-presentation
enum {
  collector(0),
  client(1),
  leader(2),
  helper(3),
  (255)
} Role;
~~~

`HpkeCiphertext` is a message encrypted using {{!HPKE=RFC9180}} and metadata
needed to decrypt it. `HpkeConfigId` identifies a server's HPKE configuration
(see {{hpke-config}}).

~~~ tls-presentation
uint8 HpkeConfigId;

struct {
  HpkeConfigId config_id;
  opaque enc<0..2^16-1>;
  opaque payload<0..2^32-1>;
} HpkeCiphertext;
~~~

`config_id` identifies the HPKE configuration to which the message was
encrypted. `enc` and `payload` correspond to the values returned by the
{{!HPKE}} `SealBase()` function. Later sections describe how to use `SealBase()`
in different situations.

`Empty` is a zero-length byte string.

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {} Empty;
~~~

### Times, Durations and Intervals {#timestamps}

~~~ tls-presentation
uint64 Time;
~~~

Times are represented by POSIX timestamps, defined to be integers containing a
number of seconds since the Epoch, defined in section 4.16 of {{POSIX}}. That
is, the number of seconds after 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, excluding leap seconds.
One POSIX timestamp is said to be before (respectively, after) another POSIX
timestamp if it is less than (respectively, greater than) the other value.

Every timestamp MUST be rounded down to the nearest multiple of the task's
`time_precision` ({{task-configuration}}). That is, the value is computed as:

~~~
rounded_timestamp = timestamp - (timestamp % time_precision)
~~~

A timestamp is malformed if `received_timestamp % time_precision > 0`.

~~~ tls-presentation
uint64 Duration;
~~~

Durations of time are integers, representing a number of seconds not including
leap seconds. They can be added to POSIX timestamps to produce other POSIX
timestamps. The duration MUST be a multiple of `time_precision`. If `duration %
time_precision > 0`, then the interval is malformed.

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  Time start;
  Duration duration;
} Interval;
~~~

Intervals of time consist of a start time and a duration. Intervals are
half-open; that is, `start` is included and `(start + duration)` is excluded. A
time that is before an `Interval`'s `start` is said to be before that interval.
A time that is equal to or after `Interval.start + Interval.duration` is said to
be after the interval. A time that is either before or after an interval is said
to be outside the interval. A time that is neither before nor after an interval
is said to be inside or fall within the interval.

### VDAF Types

The 16-byte `ReportID` is used as the nonce parameter for the VDAF `shard` and
`prep_init` methods (see {{!VDAF, Section 5}}). Additionally, DAP includes
messages defined in the VDAF specification encoded as opaque byte strings within
various DAP messages. Thus, for a VDAF to be compatible with DAP, it MUST
specify a `NONCE_SIZE` of 16 bytes, and MUST specify encodings for the following
VDAF types:

* PublicShare
* InputShare
* AggParam
* AggShare
* PrepShare
* PrepMessage

## Batch Modes, Batches, and Queries {#batch-mode}

An aggregate result is computed from a set of reports, called a "batch". The
Collector requests the aggregate result by making a "query"; the Aggregators
use this query to select a batch for aggregation.

Each measurement task has a preconfigured "batch mode". The batch mode defines
both how reports may be partitioned into batches, as well as how these batches
are addressed and the semantics of the query used for collection.

This document defines two batch modes:

* time-interval ({{time-interval-batch-mode}}) in which the query specifies a
  time interval, and the batch consists of all reports with a timestamp in that
  interval.

* leader-selected ({{leader-selected-batch-mode}}) in which the Leader assigns
  reports to batches itself, and the Collector's query simply requests the
  aggregate result for the "next" batch of reports.

Future documents may define additional batch modes for DAP; see
{{extending-this-doc}}. Implementations are free to implement only a subset of
the available batch modes.

Batch modes are identified with a single byte in serialized messages, as
follows:

~~~ tls-presentation
enum {
  reserved(0),
  time_interval(1),
  leader_selected(2),
  (255)
} BatchMode;
~~~

The query is issued to the Leader by the Collector during the collection
interaction ({{collect-flow}}). In addition, information used to guide batch
selection is conveyed from the Leader to the Helper when initializing
aggregation ({{aggregate-flow}}) and finalizing the aggregate shares.

## Task Configuration {#task-configuration}

A task represents a single measurement process, though potentially aggregating
multiple, non-overlapping batches of measurements. Each participant in a task
must agree on its configuration prior to its execution. This document does not
specify a mechanism for distributing task parameters among participants.

A task is uniquely identified by its task ID:

~~~ tls-presentation
opaque TaskID[32];
~~~

The task ID MUST be a globally unique sequence of bytes. Each task has the
following parameters associated with it:

* The VDAF which determines the type of measurements and the aggregation
  function. The VDAF itself may have further parameters (e.g., number of buckets
  in a `Prio3Histogram`).
* A URL relative to which the Leader's API resources can be found.
* A URL relative to which the Helper's API resources can be found.
* The batch mode for this task (see {{batch-mode}}), which determines how reports
  are grouped into batches.
* `task_interval` (`Interval`): Reports whose timestamp is outside of this
  interval will be rejected by the Aggregators.
* `time_precision` (`Duration`): Used to compute timestamps in DAP. See
  {{timestamps}}.

The Leader and Helper API URLs MAY include arbitrary path components.

In addition, in order to facilitate the aggregation and collection interactions,
each of the Aggregators is configured with the following parameters:

* `min_batch_size` (`uint64`): The smallest number of reports the batch is
  allowed to include. A larger minimum batch size will yield a higher degree of
  privacy. However, this ultimately depends on the application and the nature of
  the measurements and aggregation function.
* `collector_hpke_config` (`HpkeConfig`): The {{!HPKE=RFC9180}} configuration of
  the Collector (described in {{hpke-config}}); see {{compliance}} for
  information about the HPKE configuration algorithms.
* `vdaf_verify_key` (opaque byte string): The VDAF verification key shared by
  the Aggregators. This key is used in the aggregation interaction
  ({{aggregate-flow}}). The security requirements are described in
  {{verification-key}}.

Finally, the Collector is configured with the HPKE secret key corresponding to
`collector_hpke_config`.

A task's parameters are immutable for the lifetime of that task. The only way to
change parameters or to rotate secret values like collector HPKE configuration
or the VDAF verification key is to configure a new task.

## Resource URLs

DAP is defined in terms of "resources", such as reports ({{upload-flow}}),
aggregation jobs ({{aggregate-flow}}), and collection jobs ({{collect-flow}}).
Each resource has an associated URL. Resource URLs are specified by a sequence
of string literals and variables. Variables are expanded into strings according
to the following rules:

* Variables `{leader}` and `{helper}` are replaced with the base API URL of the
  Leader and Helper respectively (the base URLs are defined in
  {{task-configuration}}).
* Variables `{task-id}`, `{aggregation-job-id}`, and `{collection-job-id}` are
  replaced with the task ID ({{task-configuration}}), aggregation job ID
  ({{agg-init}}), and collection job ID ({{collect-init}}) respectively. The
  value MUST be encoded in its URL-safe, unpadded Base 64 representation as
  specified in {{Sections 5 and 3.2 of !RFC4648}}.

For example, given a helper URL "https://example.com/api/dap", task ID "f0 16 34
47 36 4c cf 1b c0 e3 af fc ca 68 73 c9 c3 81 f6 4a cd f9 02 06 62 f8 3f 46 c0 72
19 e7" and an aggregation job ID "95 ce da 51 e1 a9 75 23 68 b0 d9 61 f9 46 61
28" (32 and 16 byte octet strings, represented in hexadecimal), resource URL
`{helper}/tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}` would be
expanded into
`https://example.com/api/dap/tasks/8BY0RzZMzxvA46_8ymhzycOB9krN-QIGYvg_RsByGec/aggregation_jobs/lc7aUeGpdSNosNlh-UZhKA`.

## Aggregation Parameter Validation {#agg-param-validation}

For each batch it collects, the Collector assigns an aggregation parameter used
to refine the measurements before aggregating them. The aggregation parameter
is subject to a validation procedure specified by the VDAF.

Before accepting a collection job from the Collector ({{collect-init}}), the
Leader checks that the indicated aggregation parameter, `agg_param`, is valid
according to the following procedure. The Helper does the same before accepting
an aggregation job from the Leader ({{aggregation-helper-init}}).

1. Decode the byte string `agg_param` into an `AggParam` as specified by the
   VDAF. (VDAFs compatible with this specification MUST specify an encoding of
   the aggregation parameter as a byte string; see {{basic-definitions}}.)
   If decoding fails, then the aggregation parameter is invalid.

1. Run `vdaf.is_valid(decoded_agg_param, [])`, where `decoded_agg_param` is the
   decoded `AggParam` and `is_valid()` is as defined in {{Section 5.3 of
   !VDAF}}. If the output is not `True`, then the aggregation parameter is
   invalid.

If both steps succeed, then the aggregation parameter is deemed to be valid.

## Uploading Reports {#upload-flow}

Clients periodically upload reports to the Leader. Each report contains two
"report shares", one for the Leader and another for the Helper. The Helper's
report share is transmitted by the Leader during the aggregation interaction
(see {{aggregate-flow}}).

### HPKE Configuration Request {#hpke-config}

Before the Client can upload its report to the Leader, it must know the HPKE
configuration of each Aggregator. See {{compliance}} for information on HPKE
algorithm choices.

Clients retrieve the HPKE configuration from each Aggregator by sending an HTTP
GET request to `{aggregator}/hpke_config`.

An Aggregator responds to well-formed requests with HTTP status code 200 OK and
an `HpkeConfigList` value, with media type "application/dap-hpke-config-list".
The `HpkeConfigList` structure contains one or more `HpkeConfig` structures in
decreasing order of preference. This allows an Aggregator to support multiple
HPKE configurations simultaneously.

~~~ tls-presentation
HpkeConfig HpkeConfigList<0..2^16-1>;

struct {
  HpkeConfigId id;
  HpkeKemId kem_id;
  HpkeKdfId kdf_id;
  HpkeAeadId aead_id;
  HpkePublicKey public_key;
} HpkeConfig;

opaque HpkePublicKey<0..2^16-1>;
uint16 HpkeAeadId; /* Defined in [HPKE] */
uint16 HpkeKemId;  /* Defined in [HPKE] */
uint16 HpkeKdfId;  /* Defined in [HPKE] */
~~~

Aggregators MUST allocate distinct id values for each `HpkeConfig` in an
`HpkeConfigList`.

The Client MUST abort if any of the following happen for any HPKE config
request:

* the GET request did not return a valid HPKE config list;
* the HPKE config list is empty; or
* no HPKE config advertised by the Aggregator specifies a supported a KEM, KDF,
  or AEAD algorithm triple.

Aggregators SHOULD use HTTP caching to permit client-side caching of this
resource {{!RFC5861}}. Aggregators SHOULD favor long cache lifetimes to avoid
frequent cache revalidation, e.g., on the order of days. Aggregators can control
this cached lifetime with the Cache-Control header, as in this example:

~~~ http-message
  Cache-Control: max-age=86400
~~~

Servers should choose a `max-age` value appropriate to the lifetime of their
keys. Clients SHOULD follow the usual HTTP caching {{!RFC9111}} semantics for
HPKE configurations.

Note: Long cache lifetimes may result in Clients using stale HPKE
configurations; Aggregators SHOULD continue to accept reports with old keys for
at least twice the cache lifetime in order to avoid rejecting reports.

### Upload Request

Clients upload reports by using an HTTP POST to
`{leader}/tasks/{task-id}/reports`. The payload is a `Report`, with media type
"application/dap-report", structured as follows:

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  ReportID report_id;
  Time time;
  Extension public_extensions<0..2^16-1>;
} ReportMetadata;

struct {
  ReportMetadata report_metadata;
  opaque public_share<0..2^32-1>;
  HpkeCiphertext leader_encrypted_input_share;
  HpkeCiphertext helper_encrypted_input_share;
} Report;
~~~

* `report_metadata` is public metadata describing the report.

   * `report_id` is used by the Aggregators to ensure the report is not
      replayed ({{agg-flow}}). The Client MUST generate this by generating 16
      random bytes using a cryptographically secure random number generator.

    * `time` is the time at which the report was generated. The Client MUST
      truncate their timestamp as described in {{timestamps}}.

    * `public_extensions` is the list of public report extensions; see
      {{report-extensions}}.

* `public_share` is the public share output by the VDAF sharding algorithm. Note
  that the public share might be empty, depending on the VDAF.

* `leader_encrypted_input_share` is the Leader's encrypted input share.

* `helper_encrypted_input_share` is the Helper's encrypted input share.

Aggregators MAY require Clients to authenticate when uploading reports (see
{{client-auth}}). If it is used, HTTP client authentication MUST use a scheme
that meets the requirements in {{request-authentication}}.

The handling of the upload request by the Leader MUST be idempotent as discussed
in {{Section 9.2.2 of !RFC9110}}.

To generate a report, the Client begins by sharding its measurement into input
shares and the public share using the VDAF's sharding algorithm ({{Section 5.1
of !VDAF}}), using the report ID as the nonce:

~~~ pseudocode
(public_share, input_shares) = Vdaf.shard(
    "dap-14" || task_id,
    measurement, /* plaintext measurement */
    report_id,   /* nonce */
    rand,        /* randomness for sharding algorithm */
)
~~~

where `task_id` is the task ID. The last input comprises the randomness
consumed by the sharding algorithm. The sharding randomness is a random byte
string of length specified by the VDAF. The Client MUST generate this using a
cryptographically secure random number generator.

The sharding algorithm will return two input shares. The first input share
returned from the sharding algorithm is considered to be the Leader's input
share, and the second input share is considered to be the Helper's input share.

The Client then wraps each input share in the following structure:

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  Extension private_extensions<0..2^16-1>;
  opaque payload<0..2^32-1>;
} PlaintextInputShare;
~~~

Field `private_extensions` is set to the list of private report extensions
intended to be consumed by the given Aggregator. (See {{report-extensions}}.)
Field `payload` is set to the Aggregator's input share output by the VDAF
sharding algorithm.

Next, the Client encrypts each PlaintextInputShare `plaintext_input_share` as
follows:

~~~ pseudocode
enc, payload = SealBase(pk,
  "dap-14 input share" || 0x01 || server_role,
  input_share_aad, plaintext_input_share)
~~~

where `pk` is the Aggregator's public key; `0x01` represents the Role of the
sender (always the Client); `server_role` is the Role of the intended recipient
(`0x02` for the Leader and `0x03` for the Helper), `plaintext_input_share` is
the Aggregator's PlaintextInputShare, and `input_share_aad` is an encoded
message of type InputShareAad defined below, constructed from the same values as
the corresponding fields in the report. The `SealBase()` function is as
specified in {{!HPKE, Section 6.1}} for the ciphersuite indicated by the HPKE
configuration.

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  TaskID task_id;
  ReportMetadata report_metadata;
  opaque public_share<0..2^32-1>;
} InputShareAad;
~~~

The Leader responds to well-formed requests with HTTP status code 201
Created. Malformed requests are handled as described in {{errors}}.
Clients SHOULD NOT upload the same measurement value in more than one report if
the Leader responds with HTTP status code 201 Created.

If the Leader does not recognize the task ID, then it MUST abort with error
`unrecognizedTask`. Note that indicating an unrecognized task might indicate
that the Client is misconfigured or the task has expired.

The Leader responds to requests whose Leader encrypted input share uses an
out-of-date or unknown `HpkeConfig.id` value, indicated by
`HpkeCiphertext.config_id`, with error of type 'outdatedConfig'. When the Client
receives an 'outdatedConfig' error, it SHOULD invalidate any cached
HpkeConfigList and retry with a freshly generated Report. If this retried upload
does not succeed, the Client SHOULD abort and discontinue retrying.

If a report's ID matches that of a previously uploaded report, the Leader MUST
ignore it. In addition, it MAY alert the Client with error `reportRejected`.

The Leader MUST ignore any report pertaining to a batch that has already been
collected (see {{input-share-validation}} for details). Otherwise, comparing
the aggregate result to the previous aggregate result may result in a privacy
violation. Note that this is also enforced by the Helper during the aggregation
interaction. The Leader MAY also abort the upload interaction and alert the
Client with error `reportRejected`.

The Leader MUST ignore any report whose timestamp is outside of the task's
`time_interval`. When it does so, it SHOULD also abort the upload interaction
and alert the Client with error `reportRejected`.

The Leader may need to buffer reports while waiting to aggregate them (e.g.,
while waiting for an aggregation parameter from the Collector; see
{{collect-flow}}). The Leader SHOULD NOT accept reports whose timestamps are too
far in the future. Implementors MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no
more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. If the Leader rejects a
report for this reason, it SHOULD abort the upload interaction and alert the
Client with error `reportTooEarly`. In this situation, the Client MAY re-upload
the report later on.

If the report contains an unrecognized public report extension, or if the
Leader's input share contains an unrecognized private report extension, then the
Leader MAY abort the upload request with error "unsupportedExtension." If the
Leader does abort for this reason, it MAY indicate the unsupported extensions in
the resulting problem document via an extension member ({{Section 3.2 of
!RFC9457}}) "unsupported_extensions" on the problem document; this member MUST
contain an array of numeric values indicating the extension code points which
were not recognized. For example, if the report upload contained two unsupported
extensions with code points `23` and `42`, the "unsupported_extensions" member
would contain the value `[23, 42]`.

If the same extension type appears more than once among the public extensions
and the private extensions in the Leader's input share, then the Leader MAY
abort the upload request with error "invalidMessage".

(Note that validation of extensions is not mandatory here because it requires
the Leader to decrypt its input share. The Leader also cannot validate the
Helper's extensions because it cannot decrypt the Helper's input share.
Mandatory validation of extensions will occur during aggregation.)

### Report Extensions {#report-extensions}

Each `ReportMetadata` contains a list of extensions public to both aggregators,
and each `PlaintextInputShare` contains a list of extensions private to the
relevant Aggregator. Clients use these extensions to convey additional
information to the Aggregators. Some extensions might be intended for both
Aggregators; others may only be intended for a specific Aggregator. (For
example, a DAP deployment might use some out-of-band mechanism for an Aggregator
to verify that reports come from authenticated Clients. It will likely be useful
to bind the extension to the input share via HPKE encryption.)

Each extension is a tag-length encoded value of the following form:

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  ExtensionType extension_type;
  opaque extension_data<0..2^16-1>;
} Extension;

enum {
  reserved(0),
  (65535)
} ExtensionType;
~~~

Field "extension_type" indicates the type of extension, and "extension_data"
contains information specific to the extension.

Extensions are mandatory-to-implement: If an Aggregator receives a report
containing an extension it does not recognize, then it MUST reject the report.
(See {{input-share-validation}} for details.)

## Verifying and Aggregating Reports {#aggregate-flow}

Once a set of Clients have uploaded their reports to the Leader, the Leader can
begin the process of validating and aggregating them with the Helper. To enable
the system to handle large batches of reports, this process can be parallelized
across many "aggregation jobs" in which small subsets of the reports are
processed independently. Each aggregation job is associated with exactly one DAP
task, but a task can have many aggregation jobs.

The primary objective of an aggregation job is to run the VDAF preparation
process described in {{!VDAF, Section 5.2}} for each report in the job.
Preparation has two purposes:

1. To "refine" the input shares into "output shares" that have the desired
   aggregatable form. For some VDAFs, like Prio3, the mapping from input to
   output shares is a fixed operation depending only on the input share, but in
   general the mapping involves an aggregation parameter chosen by the
   Collector.

1. To verify that the output shares, when combined, correspond to a valid,
   refined measurement, where validity is determined by the VDAF itself. For
   example, the Prio3Sum variant of Prio3 ({{Section 7.4.2 of !VDAF}}) requires
   that the output shares sum up to an integer in a specific range, while the
   Prio3Histogram variant ({{Section 7.4.4 of !VDAF}}) proves that output shares
   sum up to a one-hot vector representing a contribution to a single bucket of
   the histogram.

In general, refinement and verification are not distinct computations, since for
some VDAFs, verification may only be achieved implicitly as a result of the
refinement process. We instead think of these as properties of the output shares
themselves: if preparation succeeds, then the resulting output shares are
guaranteed to combine into a valid, refined measurement.

VDAF preparation is mapped onto an aggregation job as illustrated in
{{agg-flow}}. The protocol is comprised of a sequence of HTTP requests from the
Leader to the Helper, the first of which includes the aggregation parameter, the
Helper's report share for each report in the job, and for each report the
initialization step for preparation. The Helper's response, along with each
subsequent request and response, carries the remaining messages exchanged during
preparation.

{: #agg-flow title="Overview of the DAP aggregation interaction."}

The number of steps, and the type of the responses, depends on the VDAF. The
message structures and processing rules are specified in the following
subsections.

Normally, the Helper processes each step synchronously, meaning it computes
each step of the computation before producing a response to the Leader's HTTP
request. The Helper can optionally instead process each step asynchronously,
meaning the Helper responds to requests immediately, while deferring processing
to a background worker. To continue, the Leader polls the Helper until it
responds with the next step. This choice allows a Helper implementation
flexibility in choosing a request model that best supports its architecture
and use case. For instance, resource-intensive use cases, such as replay checks
across vast numbers of reports and preparation of large histograms, may be
better suited for the asynchronous model. For use cases where datastore
performance is a concern, the synchronous model may be better suited.

In general, aggregation cannot begin until the Collector specifies a query and
an aggregation parameter. However, depending on the VDAF and batch mode in use,
it is often possible to begin aggregation as soon as reports arrive. For
example, Prio3 has just one valid aggregation parameter (the empty string), and
thus allows for eager aggregation; and both the time-interval
({{time-interval-batch-mode}}) and leader-selected
({{leader-selected-batch-mode}}) batch modes defined in this document allow for
eager aggregation.

An aggregation job can be thought of as having three phases, which are
described in the remaining subsections:

- Initialization: Begin the aggregation flow by disseminating report shares and
  initializing the VDAF prep state for each report.
- Continuation: Continue the aggregation flow by exchanging prep shares and
  messages until preparation completes or an error occurs.
- Completion: Finish the aggregation flow, yielding an output share
  corresponding to each report share in the aggregation job, and update the
  appropriate aggregate shares with these output shares.

After an aggregation job is completed, each Aggregator updates running-total
aggregate shares and other values for each "batch bucket" associated with a
recovered output share, as described in {{batch-buckets}}. These values are
stored until the batch is collected as described in {{collect-flow}}.

Apart from VDAF preparation, another important task of the aggregation
interaction is to provide replay protection ({{replay-protection}}). Along with
the output shares, each Aggregator records the IDs of all reports it is has
aggregated for a given task: before committing to an output share, it checks
whether the corresponding report ID is in the set of stored IDs.

### Aggregate Initialization {#agg-init}

The Leader begins an aggregation job by choosing a set of candidate reports that
pertain to the same DAP task and a job ID which MUST be unique within the scope
of the task. The job ID is a 16-byte value, structured as follows:

~~~ tls-presentation
opaque AggregationJobID[16];
~~~

The Leader can run this process for many sets of candidate reports in parallel
as needed. After choosing a set of candidates, the Leader begins aggregation by
splitting each report into report shares, one for each Aggregator. The Leader
and Helper then run the aggregate initialization flow to accomplish two tasks:

1. Recover and determine which input report shares are valid.
1. For each valid report share, initialize the VDAF preparation process (see
   {{Section 5.2 of !VDAF}}).

The Leader and Helper initialization behavior is detailed below.

Implementation note: the Leader will generally want to associate each report
with a single aggregation job, as otherwise the duplicated reports will
eventually be discarded as a replay. However, it is likely not appropriate to
directly use the used-ID storage used for replay protection to determine which
reports can be added to an aggregation job: certain errors (e.g.
`report_too_early`) allow the report to be added to another aggregation job in
the future; but storage into the used-ID storage is permanent.

#### Leader Initialization {#leader-init}

The Leader begins the aggregate initialization by sampling a fresh
AggregationJobID.

Next, for each report in the candidate set, it checks if the report ID
corresponds to a report ID it has previously stored for this task. If so, it
marks the report as invalid and removes it from the candidate set.

Next, the Leader decrypts each of its report shares as described in
{{input-share-decryption}}, then checks input share validity as described in
{{input-share-validation}}. If either step invalidates the report, the Leader
rejects the report and removes it from the set of candidate reports.

Next, for each report the Leader executes the following procedure:

~~~ pseudocode
(state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_init(
    vdaf_verify_key,
    "dap-14" || task_id,
    agg_param,
    report_id,
    public_share,
    plaintext_input_share.payload)
~~~

where:

* `vdaf_verify_key` is the VDAF verification key for the task
* `task_id` is the task ID
* `agg_param` is the VDAF aggregation parameter provided by the Collector (see
  {{collect-flow}})
* `report_id` is the report ID, used as the nonce for VDAF sharding
* `public_share` is the report's public share
* `plaintext_input_share` is the Leader's `PlaintextInputShare`

The methods are defined in {{Section 5.8 of !VDAF}}. This process determines
the initial per-report `state`, as well as the initial `outbound` message to
send to the Helper. If `state` is of type `Rejected`, then the report is
rejected and removed from the set of candidate reports, and no message is sent
to the Helper.

If `state` is of type `Continued`, then the Leader constructs a `PrepareInit`
message structured as follows:

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  ReportMetadata report_metadata;
  opaque public_share<0..2^32-1>;
  HpkeCiphertext encrypted_input_share;
} ReportShare;

struct {
  ReportShare report_share;
  opaque payload<0..2^32-1>;
} PrepareInit;
~~~

Each of these messages is constructed as follows:

  * `report_share.report_metadata` is the report's metadata.

  * `report_share.public_share` is the report's public share.

  * `report_share.encrypted_input_share` is the Helper's encrypted input share.

  * `payload` is set to the `outbound` message computed by the previous step.

It is not possible for `state` to be of type `Finished` during Leader
initialization.

Once all the report shares have been initialized, the Leader creates an
`AggregationJobInitReq` message structured as follows:

~~~ tls-presentation
opaque BatchID[32];

struct {
  BatchMode batch_mode;
  opaque config<0..2^16-1>;
} PartialBatchSelector;

struct {
  opaque agg_param<0..2^32-1>;
  PartialBatchSelector part_batch_selector;
  PrepareInit prepare_inits<0..2^32-1>;
} AggregationJobInitReq;
~~~

This message consists of:

* `agg_param`: The VDAF aggregation parameter chosen by the Collector. Before
  initializing an aggregation job, the Leader MUST validate the parameter as
  described in {{agg-param-validation}}.

* `part_batch_selector`: The "partial batch selector" used by the Aggregators
  to determine how to aggregate each report. Its contents depends on the
  indicated batch mode: for time-interval mode, the `config` field is empty
  ({{time-interval-batch-mode}}); for leader-selected tasks, the Leader
  specifies a "batch ID" that determines the batch to which each report for
  this aggregation job belongs ({{leader-selected-batch-mode}}).

  Documents that define batch modes MUST specify the content this field; see
  {{extending-this-doc}} for details.

  The indicated batch mode MUST match the task's batch mode. Otherwise, the
  Helper MUST abort with error `invalidMessage`.

  This field is called the "partial" batch selector because, depending on the
  batch mode, it may not determine a batch. In particular, if the batch mode is
  `time_interval`, the batch is not determined until the Collector's query is
  issued (see {{batch-mode}}).

* `prepare_inits`: the sequence of `PrepareInit` messages constructed in the
  previous step.

Finally, the Leader sends an HTTP PUT request to
`{helper}/tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}` with a media
type of "application/dap-aggregation-job-init-req" and a body containing the
`AggregationJobInitReq`.

The Leader MUST authenticate its requests to the Helper using a scheme that
meets the requirements in {{request-authentication}}.

The Helper responds with HTTP status 201 Created with a body containing an
`AggregationJobResp` (see {{aggregation-helper-init}}). If the `status` field
is `ready`, the Leader proceeds onward. Otherwise, if the `status` field is
`processing`, the Leader polls the aggregation job by sending GET requests to
the URL indicated in the Location header field, until the `status` is `ready`.
The Helper's response when processing SHOULD include a Retry-After header to
suggest a polling interval to the Leader.

The `AggregationJobResp.prepare_resps` field must include exactly the same
report IDs in the same order as the Leader's `AggregationJobInitReq`. Otherwise,
the Leader MUST abort the aggregation job.

Otherwise, the Leader proceeds as follows with each report:

1. If the inbound prep response has type "continue", then the Leader computes

   ~~~ pseudocode
   (state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_continued(
       "dap-14" || task_id,
       agg_param,
       prev_state,
       inbound,
   )
   ~~~

   where:

   * `task_id` is the task ID
   * `agg_param` is the VDAF aggregation parameter provided by the Collector (see
     {{collect-flow}})
   * `prev_state` is the state computed earlier by calling
     `Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_init` or `Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_continued`
   * `inbound` is the message payload in the `PrepareResp`

   If `outbound != None`, then the Leader stores `state` and `outbound` and
   proceeds to {{aggregation-leader-continuation}}. If `outbound == None`, then
   the preparation process is complete: either `state == Rejected()`, in which
   case the Leader rejects the report and removes it from the candidate set; or
   `state == Finished(out_share)`, in which case preparation is complete and the
   Leader updates the relevant batch bucket with `out_share` as described in
   {{batch-buckets}}.

1. Else if the type is "reject", then the Leader rejects the report and removes
   it from the candidate set. The Leader MUST NOT include the report in a
   subsequent aggregation job, unless the error is `report_too_early`, in which
   case the Leader MAY include the report in a subsequent aggregation job.

1. Else the type is invalid, in which case the Leader MUST abort the
   aggregation job.

When the Leader updates a batch bucket based on `out_share`, it MUST also store
the report ID for replay protection.

(Note: Since VDAF preparation completes in a constant number of rounds, it will
never be the case that some reports are completed and others are not.)

If the Leader fails to process the response from the Helper, for example because
of a transient failure such as a network connection failure or process crash,
the Leader SHOULD re-send the original request unmodified in order to attempt
recovery (see {{aggregation-step-skew-recovery}}).

#### Helper Initialization {#aggregation-helper-init}

The Helper begins an aggregation job when it receives an `AggregationJobInitReq`
message from the Leader. For each `PrepareInit` conveyed by this message, the
Helper attempts to initialize VDAF preparation (see {{Section 5.1 of !VDAF}})
just as the Leader does. If successful, it includes the result in its response
that the Leader will use to continue preparing the report.

Upon receipt of an `AggregationJobInitReq`, the Helper checks if it recognizes
the task ID. If not, then it MUST abort with error `unrecognizedTask`.

Next, the Helper checks that the aggregation parameter is valid as described in
{{agg-param-validation}}. If the aggregation parameter is invalid, then the
Helper MUST abort with error `invalidAggregationParameter`.

Next, the Helper checks that the report IDs in
`AggregationJobInitReq.prepare_inits` are all distinct. If two preparation
initialization messages have the same report ID, then the Helper MUST abort with
error `invalidMessage`.

To process the aggregation job, the Helper computes an outbound prepare step
for each report share. This includes the following structures:

~~~ tls-presentation
enum {
  continue(0),
  finished(1)
  reject(2),
  (255)
} PrepareRespState;

enum {
  reserved(0),
  batch_collected(1),
  report_replayed(2),
  report_dropped(3),
  hpke_unknown_config_id(4),
  hpke_decrypt_error(5),
  vdaf_prep_error(6),
  task_expired(7),
  invalid_message(8),
  report_too_early(9),
  task_not_started(10),
  (255)
} ReportError;

struct {
  ReportID report_id;
  PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state;
  select (PrepareResp.prepare_resp_state) {
    case continue: opaque payload<0..2^32-1>;
    case finished: Empty;
    case reject:   ReportError report_error;
  };
} PrepareResp;
~~~

First, for each report in the request, the Helper MAY check if the report ID
corresponds to a report ID it has previously stored for this task. If so, it
rejects the report by setting the outbound preparation response to

~~~ tls-presentation
variant {
  ReportID report_id;
  PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = reject;
  ReportError report_error = report_replayed;
} PrepareResp;
~~~

where `report_id` is the report ID. Note that the Helper must perform this
check before completing the aggregation job.

Next the Helper decrypts each of its remaining report shares as described in
{{input-share-decryption}}, then checks input share validity as described in
{{input-share-validation}}. For any report that was rejected, the Helper sets
the outbound preparation response to

~~~ tls-presentation
variant {
  ReportID report_id;
  PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = reject;
  ReportError report_error;
} PrepareResp;
~~~

where `report_id` is the report ID and `report_error` is the indicated error.
For all other reports it initializes the VDAF prep state as follows (let
`inbound` denote the payload of the prep step sent by the Leader):

~~~ pseudocode
(state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_helper_init(
    vdaf_verify_key,
    "dap-14" || task_id,
    agg_param,
    report_id,
    public_share,
    plaintext_input_share.payload)
~~~

where:

* `vdaf_verify_key` is the VDAF verification key for the task
* `task_id` is the task ID
* `agg_param` is the VDAF aggregation parameter sent in the
  `AggregationJobInitReq`
* `report_id` is the report ID
* `public_share` is the report's public share
* `plaintext_input_share` is the Helper's `PlaintextInputShare`

This procedure determines the initial per-report `state`, as well as the
initial `outbound` message to send in response to the Leader. If `state` is of
type `Rejected`, then the Helper responds with

~~~ tls-presentation
variant {
  ReportID report_id;
  PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = reject;
  ReportError report_error = vdaf_prep_error;
} PrepareResp;
~~~

Otherwise the Helper responds with

~~~ tls-presentation
variant {
  ReportID report_id;
  PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = continue;
  opaque payload<0..2^32-1> = outbound;
} PrepareResp;
~~~

If `state == Continued(prep_state)`, then the Helper stores `state` to
prepare for the next continuation step ({{aggregation-helper-continuation}}).

If `state == Finished(out_share)`, the Helper MUST resolve replay of the
report. It does so by checking if the report ID was previously stored for this
task. If so, it responds with

~~~ tls-presentation
variant {
  ReportID report_id;
  PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = reject;
  Reporterror report_error = report_replayed;
} PrepareResp;
~~~

Otherwise it stores the report ID for replay protection and updates the relevant
batch bucket with `out_share` as described in {{batch-buckets}}.

Finally, the Helper creates an `AggregationJobResp` to send to the Leader. This
message is structured as follows:

~~~ tls-presentation
enum {
  processing(0),
  ready(1),
  (255)
} AggregationJobStatus;

struct {
  AggregationJobStatus status;
  select (AggregationJobResp.status) {
    case processing: Empty;
    case ready:      PrepareResp prepare_resps<0..2^32-1>;
  };
} AggregationJobResp;
~~~

where `prepare_resps` are the outbound prep steps computed in the previous step.
The order MUST match `AggregationJobInitReq.prepare_inits`.

The Helper responds to the Leader with HTTP status 201 Created, a body
consisting of the `AggregationJobResp`, and the media type
"application/dap-aggregation-job-resp".

Depending on the task parameters, processing an aggregation job may take some
time, so the Helper MAY defer computation to a background process. It does so by
responding with the field `status` set to `processing` and a Location header
field set to the relative reference
`/tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}?step=0`. The Leader then
polls the Helper by making HTTP GET requests to the aforementioned Location. The
Helper responds to GET requests with HTTP status 200, a media type of
"application/dap-aggregation-job-resp", and a body consisting of an
`AggregationJobResp` with the `status` field reflecting the current state of the
job. When the aggregation job is `processing`, the response SHOULD include a
Retry-After header field to suggest a polling interval to the Leader.

Changing an aggregation job's parameters is illegal, so further HTTP PUT
requests to `/tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}` for the
same `aggregation-job-id` but with a different `AggregationJobInitReq` in the
body MUST fail with an HTTP client error status code. For further requests with
the same `AggregationJobInitReq` in the body, the Helper SHOULD respond as it
did for the original `AggregationJobInitReq`, or otherwise fail with an HTTP
client error status code.

Additionally, it is not possible to rewind or reset the state of an aggregation
job. Once an aggregation job has been continued at least once (see
{{agg-continue-flow}}), further requests to initialize that aggregation job MUST
fail with an HTTP client error status code.

#### Input Share Decryption {#input-share-decryption}

Each report share has a corresponding task ID, report metadata (report ID,
timestamp, and public extensions), public share, and the Aggregator's encrypted
input share. Let `task_id`, `report_metadata`, `public_share`, and
`encrypted_input_share` denote these values, respectively. Given these values,
an Aggregator decrypts the input share as follows. First, it constructs an
`InputShareAad` message from `task_id`, `report_metadata`, and `public_share`.
Let this be denoted by `input_share_aad`. Then, the Aggregator looks up the HPKE
config and corresponding secret key indicated by
`encrypted_input_share.config_id` and attempts decryption of the payload with
the following procedure:

~~~ pseudocode
plaintext_input_share = OpenBase(encrypted_input_share.enc, sk,
  "dap-14 input share" || 0x01 || server_role,
  input_share_aad, encrypted_input_share.payload)
~~~

where `sk` is the HPKE secret key, `0x01` represents the Role of the sender
(always the Client), and `server_role` is the Role of the recipient Aggregator
(`0x02` for the Leader and `0x03` for the Helper). The `OpenBase()` function is
as specified in {{!HPKE, Section 6.1}} for the ciphersuite indicated by the HPKE
configuration. If decryption fails, the Aggregator marks the report share as
invalid with the error `hpke_decrypt_error`. Otherwise, the Aggregator outputs
the resulting PlaintextInputShare `plaintext_input_share`.

#### Input Share Validation {#input-share-validation}

Validating an input share will either succeed or fail. In the case of failure,
the input share is marked as invalid with a corresponding report error.

Before beginning the preparation step, Aggregators are required to perform the
following checks:

1. Check that the input share can be decoded as specified by the VDAF. If not,
   the input share MUST be marked as invalid with the error `invalid_message`.

1. Check that the report's timestamp is well-formed as specified in
   {{timestamps}}. If not, the Aggregator MUST mark the input share as invalid
   with error `invalid_message`.

1. Check if the report's timestamp is too far in the future. If the report's
   timestamp is more than a few minutes ahead of the current time, then the
   Aggregator SHOULD mark the input share as invalid with error
   `report_too_early`.

1. Check if the report's timestamp is before the task's `task_interval`. If so,
   the Aggregator MUST mark the input share as invalid with the error
   `task_not_started`.

1. Check if the report's timestamp is after the task's `task_interval`. If so,
   the Aggregator MUST mark the input share as invalid with the error
   `task_expired`.

1. Check if the public or private report extensions contain any unrecognized
   report extension types. If so, the Aggregator MUST mark the input share as
   invalid with error `invalid_message`.

1. Check if any two extensions have the same extension type across public and
   private extension fields. If so, the Aggregator MUST mark the input share as
   invalid with error `invalid_message`.

1. If the report pertains to a batch that was previously collected, then the
   input share MUST be marked as invalid with error `batch_collected`.

    * Implementation note: The Leader considers a batch to be collected once it
      has completed a collection job for a CollectionJobReq message from the
      Collector; the Helper considers a batch to be collected once it has
      responded to an `AggregateShareReq` message from the Leader. A batch is
      determined by query ({{batch-mode}}) conveyed in these messages. Queries
      must satisfy the criteria covered in {{batch-validation}}. These criteria
      are meant to restrict queries in a way that makes it easy to determine
      whether a report pertains to a batch that was collected. See
      {{distributed-systems}} for more information.

1. Finally, if an Aggregator cannot determine if an input share is valid, it
   MUST mark the input share as invalid with error `report_dropped`.
   For example, the report timestamp may be so far in the past that the state
   required to perform the check has been evicted from the Aggregator's
   long-term storage. See {{sharding-storage}} for details.

If all of the above checks succeed, the input share is not marked as invalid.

### Aggregate Continuation {#agg-continue-flow}

In the continuation phase, the Leader drives the VDAF preparation of each report
in the candidate report set until the underlying VDAF moves into a terminal
state, yielding an output share for both Aggregators or a rejection.

Whether this phase is reached depends on the VDAF: for 1-round VDAFs, like
Prio3, processing has already completed. Continuation is required for VDAFs
that require more than one round.

#### Leader Continuation {#aggregation-leader-continuation}

The Leader begins each step of aggregation continuation with a prep state object
`state` and an outbound message `outbound` for each report in the candidate set.

The Leader advances its aggregation job to the next step (step 1 if this is the
first continuation after initialization). Then it instructs the Helper to
advance the aggregation job to the step the Leader has just reached. For each
report the Leader constructs a preparation continuation message:

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  ReportID report_id;
  opaque payload<0..2^32-1>;
} PrepareContinue;
~~~

where `report_id` is the report ID associated with `state` and `outbound`, and
`payload` is set to the `outbound` message.

Next, the Leader sends a POST request to
`{helper}/tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}` with media
type "application/dap-aggregation-job-continue-req" and body structured as:

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  uint16 step;
  PrepareContinue prepare_continues<0..2^32-1>;
} AggregationJobContinueReq;
~~~

The `step` field is the step of DAP aggregation that the Leader just reached and
wants the Helper to advance to. The `prepare_continues` field is the sequence of
preparation continuation messages constructed in the previous step. The
`PrepareContinue`s MUST be in the same order as the previous aggregate request.

The Leader MUST authenticate its requests to the Helper using a scheme that
meets the requirements in {{request-authentication}}.

The Helper responds with HTTP status 202 Accepted with a body containing an
`AggregationJobResp` (see {{aggregation-helper-init}}). If the `status` field
is `ready`, the Leader proceeds onward. Otherwise, if the `status` field is
`processing`, the Leader polls the aggregation job by sending GET requests to
the URL indicated in the Location header field, until the `status` is
`ready`. The Helper's response when processing SHOULD include a Retry-After
header to suggest a polling interval to the Leader.

The response's `prepare_resps` MUST include exactly the same report IDs in the
same order as the Leader's `AggregationJobContinueReq`. Otherwise, the Leader
MUST abort the aggregation job.

Otherwise, the Leader proceeds as follows with each report:

1. If the inbound prep response type is "continue" and the state is
   `Continued(prep_state)`, then the Leader computes

   ~~~ pseudocode
   (state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_continued(
       "dap-14" || task_id,
       agg_param,
       state,
       inbound,
   )
   ~~~

   where `task_id` is the task ID and `inbound` is the message payload. If
   `outbound != None`, then the Leader stores `state` and `outbound` and
   proceeds to another continuation step. If `outbound == None`, then the
   preparation process is complete: either `state == Rejected()`, in which case
   the Leader rejects the report and removes it from the candidate set; or
   `state == Finished(out_share)`, in which case preparation is complete and
   the Leader updates the relevant batch bucket with `out_share` as described in
   {{batch-buckets}}.

1. Else if the type is "finished" and `state == Finished(out_share)`, then
   preparation is complete and the Leader stores the output share for use in
   the collection interaction ({{collect-flow}}).

1. Else if the type is "reject", then the Leader rejects the report and removes
   it from the candidate set.

1. Else the type is invalid, in which case the Leader MUST abort the
   aggregation job.

When the Leader stores the `out_share`, it MUST also store the report ID for
replay protection.

If the Leader fails to process the response from the Helper, for example because
of a transient failure such as a network connection failure or process crash,
the Leader SHOULD re-send the original request unmodified in order to attempt
recovery (see {{aggregation-step-skew-recovery}}).

#### Helper Continuation {#aggregation-helper-continuation}

The Helper begins each step of continuation with a sequence of `state` objects,
which will be `Continued(prep_state)`, one for each report in the candidate set.

The Helper awaits an HTTP POST request to
`{helper}/tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}` from the
Leader, the body of which is an `AggregationJobContinueReq` as specified in
{{aggregation-leader-continuation}}.

Next, it checks that it recognizes the task ID. If not, then it MUST abort with
error `unrecognizedTask`.

Next, it checks if it recognizes the indicated aggregation job ID. If not, it
MUST abort with error `unrecognizedAggregationJob`.

Next, the Helper checks that:

1. the report IDs are all distinct
1. each report ID corresponds to one of the `state` objects
1. `AggregationJobContinueReq.step` is not equal to `0`

If any of these checks fail, then the Helper MUST abort with error
`invalidMessage`. Additionally, if any prep step appears out of order relative
to the previous request, then the Helper MAY abort with error `invalidMessage`.
(Note that a report may be missing, in which case the Helper should assume the
Leader rejected it.)

Next, the Helper checks if the continuation step indicated by the request is
correct. (For the first `AggregationJobContinueReq` the value should be `1`; for
the second the value should be `2`; and so on.) If the Leader is one step behind
(e.g., the Leader has resent the previous HTTP request), then the Helper MAY
attempt to recover by sending the same response as it did for the previous
`AggregationJobContinueReq`, without performing any additional work on the
aggregation job. In this case it SHOULD verify that the contents of the
`AggregationJobContinueReq` are identical to the previous message (see
{{aggregation-step-skew-recovery}}). Otherwise, if the step is incorrect or if
the Helper does not wish to attempt recovery, the Helper MUST abort with error
`stepMismatch`.

Let `inbound` denote the payload of the prep step. For each report, the Helper
computes the following:

~~~ pseudocode
(state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_helper_continued(
    "dap-14" || task_id,
    agg_param,
    state,
    inbound,
)
~~~

where `task_id` is the task ID. If `state == Rejected()`, then the Helper's
response is

~~~ tls-presentation
variant {
  ReportID report_id;
  PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = reject;
  ReportError report_error = vdaf_prep_error;
} PrepareResp;
~~~

If `state == Continued(prep_state)`, then the Helper stores `state` to
prepare for the next continuation step ({{aggregation-helper-continuation}}).

If `state == Finished(out_share)`, the Helper MUST resolve replay of the
report. It does so by checking if the report ID was previously stored for this
task. If so, it responds with

~~~ tls-presentation
variant {
  ReportID report_id;
  PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = reject;
  ReportError report_error = report_replayed;
} PrepareResp;
~~~

Otherwise it stores the report ID for replay protection and updates the relevant
batch bucket with `out_share` as described in {{batch-buckets}}.

The Helper's response depends on the value of `outbound`. If `outbound !=
None`, then the Helper's response is

~~~ tls-presentation
variant {
  ReportID report_id;
  PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = continue;
  opaque payload<0..2^32-1> = outbound;
} PrepareResp;
~~~

Otherwise, if `outbound == None`, then the Helper's response is

~~~ tls-presentation
variant {
  ReportID report_id;
  PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = finished;
} PrepareResp;
~~~

The Helper constructs an `AggregationJobResp` message (see
{{aggregation-helper-init}}) with each prep step. The order of the prep steps
MUST match the Leader's `AggregationJobContinueReq`.

The Helper responds to the Leader with HTTP status 202 Accepted, a body
consisting of the `AggregationJobResp`, and the media type
"application/dap-aggregation-job-resp".

Depending on the task parameters, processing an aggregation job may take some
time, so the Helper MAY defer computation to a background process by responding
with the field `status` set to `processing` and Location header field set to the
relative reference
`/tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}?step={step}`, where
`step` is the step indicated in the `AggregationJobContinueReq`. If so, the
Leader polls the Helper by making HTTP GET requests to the aforementioned
Location. The Helper responds to GET requests with HTTP status 200, a media type
of "application/dap-aggregation-job-resp", and a body consisting of an
`AggregationJobResp` with the `status` field reflecting the current state of the
job. When the aggregation job is `processing`, the response SHOULD include a
Retry-After header field to suggest a polling interval to the Leader.

If for whatever reason the Leader must abandon the aggregation job, it SHOULD
send an HTTP DELETE request to
`{helper}/tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}` so that the
Helper knows it can clean up its state.

#### Batch Buckets {#batch-buckets}

When aggregation recovers an output share, it must be stored into an appropriate
"batch bucket", which is defined in this section. The data stored in a batch
bucket is kept for eventual use in the {{collect-flow}}.

Batch buckets are indexed by a "batch bucket identifier" as as specified by the
task's batch mode:

* For the time-interval batch mode ({{time-interval-batch-mode}}, the batch
  bucket identifier is an interval of time and is determined by the report's timestamp.
* For the leader-selected batch mode ({{leader-selected-batch-mode}}), the
  batch bucket identifier is the batch ID and indicated in the aggregation job.

A few different pieces of information are associated with each batch bucket:

* A VDAF-specific aggregate share, as defined in {{!VDAF}}.
* A count of a number of reports included in the batch bucket.
* A 32-byte checksum value, as defined below.

When processing an output share `out_share`, the following procedure is used to
update the batch buckets:

* Look up the existing batch bucket for the batch bucket identifier
  associated with the aggregation job and output share.
  * If there is no existing batch bucket, initialize a new one. The initial
    aggregate share value is computed as `Vdaf.agg_init(agg_param)`, where
    `agg_param` is the aggregation parameter associated with the aggregation job
    (see {{!VDAF, Section 4.4}}); the initial count is `0`; and the initial
    checksum is 32 zero bytes.
* Update the aggregate share `agg_share` to `Vdaf.agg_update(agg_param,
  agg_share, out_share)`.
* Increment the count by 1.
* Update the checksum value to the bitwise-XOR of the checksum value with the
  SHA256 {{!SHS=DOI.10.6028/NIST.FIPS.180-4}} hash of the report ID associated
  with the output share.

Implementation note: this section describes a single set of values associated
with each batch bucket. However, implementations are free to shard the aggregate
share/count/checksum values associated with the batch bucket, combining them
back into a single set of values when reading the batch bucket. This may be
useful to avoid write contention. The aggregate share values are combined using
`Vdaf.merge(agg_param, agg_shares)` (see {{!VDAF, Section 4.4}}), the count
values are combined by summing, and the checksum values are combined by bitwise
XOR.

#### Recovering from Aggregation Step Skew {#aggregation-step-skew-recovery}

`AggregationJobContinueReq` messages contain a `step` field, allowing
Aggregators to ensure that their peer is on an expected step of DAP
aggregation. In particular, the intent is to allow recovery from a scenario
where the Helper successfully advances from step `n` to `n+1`, but its
`AggregationJobResp` response to the Leader gets dropped due to something like
a transient network failure. The Leader could then resend the request to have
the Helper advance to step `n+1` and the Helper should be able to retransmit
the `AggregationJobResp` that was previously dropped. To make that kind of
recovery possible, Aggregator implementations SHOULD checkpoint the most recent
step's prep state and messages to durable storage such that the Leader can
re-construct continuation requests and the Helper can re-construct continuation
responses as needed.

When implementing an aggregation step skew recovery strategy, the Helper SHOULD
ensure that the Leader's `AggregationJobContinueReq` message did not change when
it was re-sent (i.e., the two messages must be identical). This prevents the
Leader from re-winding an aggregation job and re-running an aggregation step
with different parameters.

One way the Helper could address this would be to store a digest of the Leader's
request, indexed by aggregation job ID and step, and refuse to service a request
for a given aggregation step unless it matches the previously seen request (if
any).

## Collecting Results {#collect-flow}

In this phase, the Collector requests aggregate shares from each Aggregator and
then locally combines them to yield a single aggregate result. In particular,
the Collector issues a query to the Leader ({{batch-mode}}), which the
Aggregators use to select a batch of reports to aggregate. Each Aggregator emits
an aggregate share encrypted to the Collector so that it can decrypt and combine
them to yield the aggregate result. This entire process is composed of two
interactions:

1. Collect request and response between the Collector and Leader, specified in
   {{collect-init}}
1. Aggregate share request and response between the Leader and the Helper,
   specified in {{collect-aggregate}}

Once complete, the Collector computes the final aggregate result as specified in
{{collect-finalization}}.

This overall process is referred to as a "collection job".

### Collection Job Initialization {#collect-init}

First, the Collector chooses a collection job ID:

~~~ tls-presentation
opaque CollectionJobID[16];
~~~

This ID value MUST be unique within the scope of the corresponding DAP task.

To initiate the collection job, the collector issues a PUT request to
`{leader}/tasks/{task-id}/collection_jobs/{collection-job-id}`. The body of the
request has media type "application/dap-collection-job-req", and it is structured
as follows:

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  BatchMode batch_mode;
  opaque config<0..2^16-1>;
} Query;

struct {
  Query query;
  opaque agg_param<0..2^32-1>; /* VDAF aggregation parameter */
} CollectionJobReq;
~~~

The named parameters are:

* `query`, the Collector's query. The content of this field depends on the
  indicated batch mode: for time-interval mode, the `config` field contains the
  requested time interval ({{time-interval-batch-mode}}); for leader-selected
  mode, the `config` field is empty, and the Collector gets the aggregate
  result for the next batch selected by the Leader
  ({{leader-selected-batch-mode}}).

  Batch modes defined by future documents MUST specify the content of this field;
  see {{extending-this-doc}} for details.

  The indicated batch mode MUST match the task's batch mode. Otherwise, the
  Leader MUST abort with error "invalidMessage".

* `agg_param`, an aggregation parameter for the VDAF being executed. This is
  the same value as in `AggregationJobInitReq` (see {{leader-init}}). The
  aggregation parameter MUST be valid as defined in {{agg-param-validation}}.

Collectors MUST authenticate their requests to Leaders using a scheme that meets
the requirements in {{request-authentication}}.

Depending on the VDAF scheme and how the Leader is configured, the Leader and
Helper may already have prepared a sufficient number of reports satisfying the
query and be ready to return the aggregate shares right away. However, this is
not always the case. In fact, for some VDAFs, it is not be possible to begin
running aggregation jobs ({{aggregate-flow}}) until the Collector initiates a
collection job. This is because, in general, the aggregation parameter is not
known until this point. In certain situations it is possible to predict the
aggregation parameter in advance. For example, for Prio3 the only valid
aggregation parameter is the empty string. For these reasons, the collection job
is handled asynchronously. If aggregation is performed eagerly, the Leader MUST
validate that the aggregation parameter received in the `CollectionJobReq`
matches the aggregation parameter used in aggregations.

Upon receipt of a `CollectionJobReq`, the Leader begins by checking that it
recognizes the task ID in the request path. If not, it MUST abort with error
`unrecognizedTask`.

Next, the Leader checks that the aggregation parameter is valid as described in
{{agg-param-validation}}. If the aggregation parameter is invalid, then the
Leader MUST abort with error `invalidAggregationParameter`.

The Leader MAY further validate the request according to the requirements in
{{batch-validation}} and abort with the indicated error, though some conditions
such as the number of valid reports may not be verifiable while handling the
`CollectionJobReq` message, and the batch will have to be re-validated later on
regardless.

Changing a collection job's parameters is illegal, so further requests to
`PUT /tasks/{task-id}/collection_jobs/{collection-job-id}` for the same
`collection-job-id` but with a different `CollectionJobReq` in the body MUST
fail with an HTTP client error status code.

The Leader responds to `CollectionJobReq`s with a `CollectionJobResp`, which is
structured as follows:

~~~ tls-presentation
enum {
  processing(0),
  ready(1),
  (255)
} CollectionJobStatus;

struct {
  PartialBatchSelector part_batch_selector;
  uint64 report_count;
  Interval interval;
  HpkeCiphertext leader_encrypted_agg_share;
  HpkeCiphertext helper_encrypted_agg_share;
} Collection;

struct {
  CollectionJobStatus status;
  select (CollectionJob.status) {
    case processing: Empty;
    case ready:      Collection;
  }
} CollectionJobResp;
~~~

The body's media type is "application/dap-collection-job-resp". The `Collection`
structure includes the following:

* `part_batch_selector`: Information used to bind the aggregate result to the
  query. For leader-selected tasks, this includes the batch ID assigned to the
  batch by the Leader. The indicated batch mode MUST match the task's batch
  mode.

* `report_count`: The number of reports included in the batch.

* `interval`: The smallest interval of time that contains the timestamps of all
  reports included in the batch. Note that in the case of a time-interval query
  ({{time-interval-batch-mode}}), this interval can be smaller than the one in
  the corresponding `CollectionJobReq.query`.

* `leader_encrypted_agg_share`: The Leader's aggregate share, encrypted to the
  Collector (see {{aggregate-share-encrypt}}).

* `helper_encrypted_agg_share`: The Helper's aggregate share, encrypted to the
  Collector (see {{aggregate-share-encrypt}}).

If the Leader finds the `CollectionJobReq` to be valid, it immediately responds
with HTTP status 201 Created with a body containing a `CollectionJobResp` with
the `status` field set to `processing`. The Leader SHOULD include a Retry-After
header field to suggest a polling interval to the Collector.

After receiving the response to its `CollectionJobReq`, the Collector
periodically makes HTTP GET requests
`/tasks/{task-id}/collection_jobs/{collection-job-id}` to check on the status
of the collection job and eventually obtain the result. The Leader responds to GET
requests with HTTP status 200 and the `status` field reflecting the current
state of the job. When the collection job is `processing`, the response SHOULD
include a Retry-After header field to suggest a polling interval to the
Collector.

The Leader then begins working with the Helper to aggregate the reports
satisfying the query (or continues this process, depending on the VDAF) as
described in {{aggregate-flow}}.

The Leader first checks whether it can construct a batch for the
collection job by applying the requirements in {{batch-validation}}. If so, then
the Leader obtains the Helper's aggregate share following the aggregate-share
request flow described in {{collect-aggregate}}. If not, it either aborts the
collection job or tries again later, depending on which requirement in
{{batch-validation}} was not met. If the Leader has a pending aggregation job
that overlaps with the batch and aggregation parameter for the collection job,
the Leader MUST first complete the aggregation job before proceeding and
requesting an aggregate share from the Helper. This avoids a race condition
between aggregation and collection jobs that can yield trivial batch mismatch
errors.

Once both aggregate shares are successfully obtained, the Leader responds to
subsequent HTTP GET requests with the `status` field set to `ready` and the
`Collection` field populated with the encrypted aggregate shares. The Collector
stops polling once receiving this final request.

If obtaining aggregate shares fails, then the Leader responds to subsequent HTTP
GET requests to the collection job with an HTTP error status and a problem
document as described in {{errors}}.

The Leader MAY respond with HTTP status 204 No Content to requests to a
collection job if the results have been deleted.

The Collector can send an HTTP DELETE request to the collection job, which
indicates to the Leader that it can abandon the collection job and discard all
state related to it.

### Obtaining Aggregate Shares {#collect-aggregate}

The Leader must compute its own aggregate share, as well as obtaining the
Helper's encrypted aggregate share, before it can complete a collection job.

First, the Leader retrieves all batch buckets ({{batch-buckets}}) associated
with this collection job. The batch buckets to retrieve depend on the batch mode
of this task:

* For time-interval ({{time-interval-batch-mode}}), this is all batch buckets
  whose batch bucket identifiers are contained within the batch interval
  specified in the `CollectionJobReq`'s query.
* For leader-selected ({{leader-selected-batch-mode}}), this is the batch
  bucket associated with the batch ID the Leader has chosen for this collection
  job.

The Leader then combines the values inside the batch bucket as follows:

* Aggregate shares are combined via `Vdaf.merge(agg_param, agg_shares)` ((see
  {{!VDAF, Section 4.4}})), where `agg_param` is the aggregation parameter
  provided in the `CollectionJobReq`, and `agg_shares` are the (partial)
  aggregate shares in the batch buckets. The result is the final aggregate share
  for this collection job.
* Report counts are combined via summing.
* Checksums are combined via bitwise XOR.

Then the Leader sends a POST request to
`{helper}/tasks/{task-id}/aggregate_shares` with the following message:

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  BatchMode batch_mode;
  opaque config<0..2^16-1>;
} BatchSelector;

struct {
  BatchSelector batch_selector;
  opaque agg_param<0..2^32-1>;
  uint64 report_count;
  opaque checksum[32];
} AggregateShareReq;
~~~

The media type of the request is "application/dap-aggregate-share-req". The
message contains the following parameters:

* `batch_selector`: The "batch selector", the contents of which depends on the
  indicated batch mode: for time-interval mode, the `config` field contains the
  time interval selected by the Collector ({{time-interval-batch-mode}}); in
  leader-selected mode, the field contains the batch ID selected by the Leader
  ({{leader-selected-batch-mode}}).

  Future documents that new batch modes MUST specify the contents of the
  `config` field; see {{extending-this-doc}} for details.

  The indicated batch mode MUST match the task's batch mode. Otherwise, the
  Helper MUST abort with "invalidMessage".

* `agg_param`: The opaque aggregation parameter for the VDAF being executed.
  This value MUST match the `AggregationJobInitReq` message for each aggregation
  job used to compute the aggregate shares (see {{leader-init}}) and the
  aggregation parameter indicated by the Collector in the CollectionJobReq
  message (see {{collect-init}}).

* `report_count`: The number number of reports included in the batch, as
  computed above.

* `checksum`: The batch checksum, as computed above.

Leaders MUST authenticate their requests to Helpers using a scheme that meets
the requirements in {{request-authentication}}.

To handle the Leader's request, the Helper first ensures that it recognizes the
task ID in the request path. If not, it MUST abort with error
`unrecognizedTask`. The Helper then verifies that the request meets the
requirements for batch parameters following the procedure in
{{batch-validation}}. The Helper MUST validate that the aggregation parameter
matches the aggregation parameter used during aggregation of this batch;
otherwise, it aborts with "invalidMessage".

Next, the Helper retrieves and combines the batch buckets associated with the
request using the same process used by the Leader (as described at the beginning
of this section {{collect-aggregate}}), arriving at its final aggregate share,
report count, and checksum values. If the Helper's computed report count and
checksum values do not match the values provided in the `AggregateShareReq`, it
MUST abort with an error of type "batchMismatch".

The Helper then encrypts `agg_share` under the Collector's HPKE public key as
described in {{aggregate-share-encrypt}}, yielding `encrypted_agg_share`.
Encryption prevents the Leader from learning the actual result, as it only has
its own aggregate share and cannot compute the Helper's.

The Helper responds to the Leader with HTTP status code 200 OK and a body
consisting of an `AggregateShare`, with media type
"application/dap-aggregate-share":

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  HpkeCiphertext encrypted_aggregate_share;
} AggregateShare;
~~~

`encrypted_aggregate_share.config_id` is set to the Collector's HPKE config ID.
`encrypted_aggregate_share.enc` is set to the encapsulated HPKE context `enc`
computed above and `encrypted_aggregate_share.ciphertext` is the ciphertext
`encrypted_agg_share` computed above.

The Helper's handling of this request MUST be idempotent. That is, if multiple
identical, valid `AggregateShareReq`s are received, they should all yield the
same response.

After receiving the Helper's response, the Leader uses the HpkeCiphertext to
finalize a collection job (see {{collect-finalization}}).

Once an `AggregateShareReq` has been issued for the batch determined by a given
query, it is an error for the Leader to issue any more aggregation jobs for
additional reports that satisfy the query. These reports will be rejected by the
Helper as described in {{input-share-validation}}.

Before completing the collection job, the Leader encrypts its aggregate share
under the Collector's HPKE public key as described in
{{aggregate-share-encrypt}}.

### Collection Job Finalization {#collect-finalization}

Once the Collector has received a collection job from the Leader, it can decrypt
the aggregate shares and produce an aggregate result. The Collector decrypts
each aggregate share as described in {{aggregate-share-encrypt}}. Once the
Collector successfully decrypts all aggregate shares, it unshards the aggregate
shares into an aggregate result using the VDAF's `unshard` algorithm. In
particular, let `leader_agg_share` denote the Leader's aggregate share,
`helper_agg_share` denote the Helper's aggregate share, let `report_count`
denote the report count sent by the Leader, and let `agg_param` be the opaque
aggregation parameter. The final aggregate result is computed as follows:

~~~ pseudocode
agg_result = Vdaf.unshard(agg_param,
                          [leader_agg_share, helper_agg_share],
                          report_count)
~~~

### Aggregate Share Encryption {#aggregate-share-encrypt}

Encrypting an aggregate share `agg_share` for a given `AggregateShareReq` is
done as follows:

~~~ pseudocode
(enc, payload) = SealBase(
    pk,
    "dap-14 aggregate share" || server_role || 0x00,
    agg_share_aad,
    agg_share)
~~~

where `pk` is the HPKE public key encoded by the Collector's HPKE key,
`server_role` is the Role of the encrypting server (`0x02` for the Leader and
`0x03` for a Helper), `0x00` represents the Role of the recipient (always the
Collector), and `agg_share_aad` is a value of type `AggregateShareAad`. The
`SealBase()` function is as specified in {{!HPKE, Section 6.1}} for the
ciphersuite indicated by the HPKE configuration.

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  TaskID task_id;
  opaque agg_param<0..2^32-1>;
  BatchSelector batch_selector;
} AggregateShareAad;
~~~

* `task_id` is the ID of the task the aggregate share was computed in.
* `agg_param` is the aggregation parameter used to compute the aggregate share.
* `batch_selector` is the is the batch selector from the `AggregateShareReq`
  (for the Helper) or the batch selector computed from the Collector's query
  (for the Leader).

The Collector decrypts these aggregate shares using the opposite process.
Specifically, given an encrypted input share, denoted `enc_share`, for a given
batch selector, decryption works as follows:

~~~ pseudocode
agg_share = OpenBase(
    enc_share.enc,
    sk,
    "dap-14 aggregate share" || server_role || 0x00,
    agg_share_aad,
    enc_share.payload)
~~~

where `sk` is the HPKE secret key, `server_role` is the Role of the server that
sent the aggregate share (`0x02` for the Leader and `0x03` for the Helper),
`0x00` represents the Role of the recipient (always the Collector), and
`agg_share_aad` is an `AggregateShareAad` message constructed from the task ID
and the aggregation parameter in the collect request, and a batch selector. The
value of the batch selector used in `agg_share_aad` is determined by the batch mode.

* For time-interval ({{time-interval-batch-mode}}), the batch selector is the
  batch interval specified in the query.

* For leader-selected ({{leader-selected-batch-mode}}), the batch selector is
  the batch ID sent in the response.

The `OpenBase()` function is as specified in {{!HPKE, Section 6.1}} for the
ciphersuite indicated by the HPKE configuration.

### Batch Validation {#batch-validation}

When the Leader receives a `Query` in the request from the Collector during
collection initialization ({{collect-init}}), it must first check that the
batch determined by the query can be collected. It does so as described here.
The Helper performs the same check when it receives a `BatchSelector` in the
request from the Leader for its aggregate share ({{collect-aggregate}}).

First, the Aggregator checks if the request (the `CollectionJobReq` for the
Leader and the `AggregateShareReq` for the Helper) identifies a valid set of
batch buckets ({{batch-buckets}}). If not, it MUST abort the request with
"batchInvalid".

Next, the Aggregator checks that batch contains a valid number of reports. The
Aggregator checks that `len(X) >= min_batch_size`, where `X` is the set of
reports successfully aggregated into the batch and `min_batch_size` is the
minimum batch size for the task. If this check fails, then Helpers MUST abort
with an error of type "invalidBatchSize". Leaders SHOULD wait for more reports
to be validated and try the collection job again later.

Next, the Aggregator checks if the set of batch buckets identified by the
request overlaps with the batch buckets that have already been collected. If
so, it MUST abort with "batchOverlap".

Finally, the batch mode may define additional batch validation rules.

# Batch Modes

This section defines an initial set of batch modes for DAP. New batch modes may
be defined by future documents following the guidelines in
{{extending-this-doc}}.

Each batch mode specifies the following:

1. The value of the `config` field of `Query`, `PartialBatchSelector`, and
   `BatchSelector`

1. Batch buckets ({{batch-buckets}}): how reports are assigned to batch
   buckets; how each bucket is identified; and how batch buckets are mapped to
   batches and how batch buckets

## Time Interval {#time-interval-batch-mode}

The time-interval batch mode is designed to support applications in which
reports are collected into batches grouped by an interval of time. The Collector
specifies a "batch interval" that determines the time range for reports included
in the batch. For each report in the batch, the time at which that report was
generated (see {{upload-flow}}) MUST fall within the batch interval specified by
the Collector.

Typically the Collector issues queries for which the batch intervals are
continuous, monotonically increasing, and have the same duration. For example,
the sequence of batch intervals `(1659544000, 1000)`, `(1659545000, 1000)`,
`(1659546000, 1000)`, `(1659547000, 1000)` satisfies these conditions. (The
first element of the pair denotes the start of the batch interval and the second
denotes the duration.) However, this is not a requirement--the Collector may
decide to issue queries out-of-order. In addition, the Collector may need to
vary the duration to adjust to changing report upload rates.

### Query Configuration

The payload of `Query.config` is

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  Interval batch_interval;
} TimeIntervalQueryConfig;
~~~

where `batch_interval` is the batch interval requested by the Collector. The
interval MUST be well-formed as specified in {{timestamps}}. Otherwise, the
query does not specify a set of valid batch buckets.

### Partial Batch Selector Configuration

The payload of `PartialBatchSelector.config` is empty.

### Batch Selector Configuration

The payload of `BatchSelector.config` is

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  Interval batch_interval;
} TimeIntervalBatchSelectorConfig;
~~~

where `batch_interval` is the batch interval requested by the Collector.

### Batch Buckets {#time-interval-batch-buckets}

Each batch bucket is identified by an interval of time whose beginning is a
multiple of the task's `time_precision` and whose duration is equal to the
task's `time_precision`. The identifier associated with a given report is the
unique such interval containing the timestamp of the report; for example, if
the task's `time_precision` is 1000 seconds and the report's timestamp is
1729629081, the relevant batch bucket identifier is `(1729629000, 1000)`. The
first element of the pair denotes the start of the batch interval and the
second denotes the duration.

The `Query` received by the Leader determines a valid set of batch bucket
identifiers if the following conditions hold (likewise for the `BatchSelector`
received by the Helper):

* `batch_interval.duration >= time_precision` (this field determines,
  effectively, the minimum batch duration)

* both `batch_interval.start` and `batch_interval.duration` are divisible by
  `time_precision`

A batch consists of a sequence of contiguous batch buckets. That is, the set of
batch buckets identifiers for the batch interval is
`(batch_interval.start,
  batch_interval.start + time_precision)`,
`(batch_interval.start + time_precision,
  batch_interval.start + 2*time_precision)`, ...,
`(batch_interval.start + batch_interval.duration - time_precision) +
  batch_interval.start + batch_interval.duration)`.

## Leader-selected Batch Mode {#leader-selected-batch-mode}

The leader-selected batch mode is used to support applications in which it is
acceptable for reports to be batched in an arbitrary fashion by the Leader. Each
batch of reports is identified by an opaque "batch ID". Both the reports
included in each batch and the ID for each batch are allocated in an arbitrary
fashion by the Leader.

The Collector will not know the set of batch IDs available for collection. To
get the aggregate of a batch, the Collector issues a query, which does not
include any information specifying a particular batch (see {{batch-mode}}). The
Leader selects a recent batch to aggregate. The Leader MUST select a batch that
has not yet been associated with a collection job.

The Aggregators can output batches of any size that is larger than or equal to
`min_batch_size`. The target batch size, if any, is implementation-specific, and
may be equal to or greater than the minimum batch size. Deciding how soon
batches should be output is also implementation-specific. Exactly sizing batches
may be challenging for Leader deployments in which multiple, independent nodes
running the aggregate interaction (see {{aggregate-flow}}) need to be
coordinated.

### Query Configuration

They payload of `Query.config` is empty; the request merely indicates the
Collector would like the next batch selected by the Leader.

### Partial Batch Selector Configuration

The payload of `PartialBatchSelector.config` is:

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  BatchID batch_id;
} LeaderSelectedPartialBatchSelectorConfig;
~~~

where `batch_id` is the batch ID selected by the Leader.

### Batch Selector Configuration

The payload of `BatchSelector.config` is:

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  BatchID batch_id;
} LeaderSelectedBatchSelectorConfig;
~~~

where `batch_id` is the batch ID selected by the Leader.

### Batch Buckets {#leader-selected-batch-buckets}

Each batch consists of a single bucket and is identified by the batch ID
selected by the Leader. A report is assigned to the batch indicated by the
`PartialBatchSelector` during aggregation.

# Operational Considerations {#operational-capabilities}

The DAP protocol has inherent constraints derived from the tradeoff between
privacy guarantees and computational complexity. These tradeoffs influence how
applications may choose to utilize services implementing the specification.

## Protocol Participant Capabilities {#entity-capabilities}

The design in this document has different assumptions and requirements for
different protocol participants, including Clients, Aggregators, and Collectors.
This section describes these capabilities in more detail.

### Client Capabilities

Clients have limited capabilities and requirements. Their only inputs to the
protocol are (1) the parameters configured out of band and (2) a measurement.
Clients are not expected to store any state across any upload flows, nor are
they required to implement any sort of report upload retry mechanism. By design,
the protocol in this document is robust against individual Client upload
failures since the protocol output is an aggregate over all inputs.

### Aggregator Capabilities

Leaders and Helpers have different operational requirements. The design in this
document assumes an operationally competent Leader, i.e., one that has no
storage or computation limitations or constraints, but only a modestly
provisioned Helper, i.e., one that has computation, bandwidth, and storage
constraints. By design, Leaders must be at least as capable as Helpers, where
Helpers are generally required to:

- Support the aggregate interaction, which includes validating and aggregating
  reports; and
- Publish and manage an HPKE configuration that can be used for the upload
  interaction.

In addition, for each DAP task, the Helper is required to:

- Implement some form of batch-to-report index, as well as inter- and
  intra-batch replay mitigation storage, which includes some way of tracking
  batch report size. Some of this state may be used for replay attack
  mitigation. The replay mitigation strategy is described in
  {{input-share-validation}}.

Beyond the minimal capabilities required of Helpers, Leaders are generally
required to:

- Support the upload interaction and store reports; and
- Track batch report size during each collect flow and request encrypted output
  shares from Helpers.

In addition, for each DAP task, the Leader is required to:

- Implement and store state for the form of inter- and intra-batch replay
  mitigation in {{agg-flow}}. This requires storing the report IDs of all
  reports processed for a given task. Implementations may find it helpful to
  track additional information, like the timestamp, so that the storage used
  for anti-replay can be sharded efficiently.

### Collector Capabilities

Collectors statefully interact with Aggregators to produce an aggregate output.
Their input to the protocol is the task parameters, configured out of band,
which include the corresponding batch window and size. For each collect
invocation, Collectors are required to keep state from the start of the protocol
to the end as needed to produce the final aggregate output.

Collectors must also maintain state for the lifetime of each task, which
includes key material associated with the HPKE key configuration.

## VDAFs and Compute Requirements

The choice of VDAF can impact the computation and storage required for a DAP
task:

* The runtime of VDAF sharding and preparation is related to the "size" of the
  underlying measurements. For example, the Prio3SumVec VDAF defined in
  {{Section 7 of !VDAF}} requires each measurement to be a vector of the same
  length, which all parties need to agree on prior to VDAF execution. The
  computation required for such tasks increases linearly as a function of the
  chosen length, as each vector element must be processed in turn.

* The runtime of VDAF preparation is related to the size of the aggregation
  parameter. For example for Poplar1 defined in {{Section 8 of !VDAF}},
  preparation takes as input a sequence of so-called "candidate prefixes", and
  the amount of computation is linear in the number of prefixes.

* The storage requirements for aggregate shares vary depending on the size of
  the measurements and/or the aggregation parameter.

To account for these factors, care must be taken that a DAP deployment can
handle VDAF execution of all possible configurations for any tasks which the
deployment may be configured for. Otherwise, an attacker may deny service by
uploading many expensive reports to a suitably-configured VDAF.

The varying cost of VDAF computation means that Aggregators should negotiate
reasonable limits for each VDAF configuration, out of band with the protocol.
For example, Aggregators may agree on a maximum size for an aggregation job or
on a maximum rate of incoming reports.

Applications which require computationally-expensive VDAFs can mitigate the
computation cost of aggregation in a few ways, such as producing aggregates over
a sample of the data or choosing a representation of the data permitting a
simpler aggregation scheme.

## Aggregation Utility and Soft Batch Deadlines

A soft real-time system should produce a response within a deadline to be
useful. This constraint may be relevant when the value of an aggregate decreases
over time. A missed deadline can reduce an aggregate's utility but not
necessarily cause failure in the system.

An example of a soft real-time constraint is the expectation that input data can
be verified and aggregated in a period equal to data collection, given some
computational budget. Meeting these deadlines will require efficient
implementations of the VDAF. Applications might batch requests or utilize more
efficient serialization to improve throughput.

Some applications may be constrained by the time that it takes to reach a
privacy threshold defined by a minimum number of reports. One possible solution
is to increase the reporting period so more samples can be collected, balanced
against the urgency of responding to a soft deadline.

## Protocol-specific Optimizations

Not all DAP tasks have the same operational requirements, so the protocol is
designed to allow implementations to reduce operational costs in certain cases.

### Reducing Storage Requirements {#sharding-storage}

In general, the Aggregators are required to keep state for tasks and all valid
reports for as long as collection requests can be made for them. However, it is
not necessary to store the complete reports. Each Aggregator only needs to
store an aggregate share for each possible batch bucket i.e., the batch
interval for time-interval or batch ID for leader-selected, along with a flag
indicating whether the aggregate share has been collected. This is due to the
requirement for queries to respect bucket boundaries. See {{batch-validation}}.

However, Aggregators are also required to implement several per-report checks
that require retaining a number of data artifacts. For example, to detect replay
attacks, it is necessary for each Aggregator to retain the set of report IDs of
reports that have been aggregated for the task so far. Depending on the task
lifetime and report upload rate, this can result in high storage costs. To
alleviate this burden, DAP allows Aggregators to drop this state as needed, so
long as reports are dropped properly as described in {{input-share-validation}}.
Aggregators SHOULD take steps to mitigate the risk of dropping reports (e.g., by
evicting the oldest data first).

Furthermore, the Aggregators must store data related to a task as long as the
current time is not after this task's `task_interval`. Aggregators MAY delete
the task and all data pertaining to this task after the `task_interval`.
Implementors SHOULD provide for some leeway so the Collector can collect the
batch after some delay.

### Distributed-systems and Synchronization Concerns {#distributed-systems}

Various parts of a DAP implementation will need to synchronize in order to
ensure correctness during concurrent operation. This section describes the
relevant concerns and makes suggestions as to potential implementation
tradeoffs.

* The upload interaction requires the Leader to ignore uploaded reports with a
  duplicated ID, including concurrently-uploaded reports. This might be
  implemented by synchronization or via an eventually-consistent process. If the
  Leader wishes to alert the Client with a `reportRejected` error,
  synchronization will be necessary to ensure all but one concurrent request
  receive the error.

* The Leader is responsible for generating aggregation jobs, and will generally
  want to place each report in exactly one aggregation job. (The only event in
  which a Leader will want to place a report in multiple aggregation jobs is if
  the Helper rejects the report with `report_too_early`, in which case the
  Leader can place the report into a later aggregation job.) This may require
  synchronization between different components of the system which are
  generating aggregation jobs. Note that placing a report into more than one
  aggregation job will result in a loss of throughput, rather than a loss of
  correctness, privacy, or robustness, so it is acceptable for implementations
  to use an eventually-consistent scheme which may rarely place a report into
  multiple aggregation jobs.

* Aggregation is implemented as a sequence of aggregation steps by both the
  Leader and the Helper. The Leader must ensure that each aggregation job is
  only processed once concurrently, which may require synchronization between
  the components responsible for performing aggregation. The Helper must ensure
  that concurrent requests against the same aggregation job are handled
  appropriately, which requires synchronization between the components handling
  aggregation requests.

* Aggregation requires checking and updating used-report storage as part of
  implementing replay protection. This must be done while processing the
  aggregation job, though which steps the checks are performed at is up to the
  implementation. The checks and storage require synchronization, so that if two
  aggregation jobs containing the same report are processed, at most one
  instance of the report will be aggregated. However, the interaction with the
  used-report storage does not necessarily have to be synchronized with the
  processing and storage for the remainder of the aggregation process. For
  example, used-report storage could be implemented in a separate datastore than
  is used for the remainder of data storage, without any transactionality
  between updates to the two datastores.

* The aggregation and collection interactions require synchronization to avoid
  modifying the aggregate of a batch after it has already been collected. Any
  reports being aggregated which pertain to a batch which has already been
  collected must fail with a `batch_collected` error; correctly determining this
  requires synchronizing aggregation with the completion of collection jobs (for
  the Leader) or aggregate share requests (for the Helper). Also, the Leader
  must complete all outstanding aggregation jobs for a batch before requesting
  aggregate shares from the Helper, again requiring synchronization between the
  Leader's collection and aggregation interactions. Further, the Helper must
  determine the aggregated report count and checksum of aggregated report IDs
  before responding to an aggregate share request, requiring synchronization
  between the Helper's collection and aggregation interactions.

# Compliance Requirements {#compliance}

In the absence of an application or deployment-specific profile specifying
otherwise, a compliant DAP application MUST implement the following HPKE cipher
suite:

- KEM: DHKEM(X25519, HKDF-SHA256) (see {{!HPKE, Section 7.1}})
- KDF: HKDF-SHA256 (see {{!HPKE, Section 7.2}})
- AEAD: AES-128-GCM (see {{!HPKE, Section 7.3}})

# Security Considerations {#sec-considerations}

DAP aims to achieve the privacy and robustness security goals defined in
{{Section 9 of !VDAF}}, even in the presence of an active attacker. It is
assumed that the attacker may control the network and have the ability to
control a subset of of Clients, one of the Aggregators, and the Collector for a
given task.

In the presence of this adversary, there are some threats DAP does not defend
against and which are considered outside of DAP's threat model. These are
enumerated below, along with potential mitigations.

Attacks on robustness:

1. Aggregators can defeat robustness by emitting incorrect aggregate shares, by
   omitting reports from the aggregation process, or by manipulating the VDAF
   preparation process for a single report. DAP follows VDAF in providing
   robustness only if both Aggregators honestly follow the protocol.
1. Clients may affect the quality of aggregate results by reporting false
   measurements. A VDAF can only verify that a submitted measurement is valid,
   not that it is true.
1. An attacker can impersonate multiple Clients, or a single malicious Client
   can upload an unexpectedly-large number of reports, in order to skew
   aggregate results or to reduce the number of measurements from honest Clients
   in a batch below the minimum batch size. See {{sybil}} for discussion and
   potential mitigations.

Attacks on privacy:

1. Clients can intentionally leak their own measurements and compromise their
   own privacy.
1. Both Aggregators together can, purposefully or accidentally, share
   unencrypted input shares in order to defeat the privacy of individual
   reports. DAP follows VDAF in providing privacy only if at least one
   Aggregator honestly follows the protocol.

Attacks on other properties of the system:

1. Both Aggregators together can, purposefully or accidentally, share
   unencrypted aggregate shares in order to reveal the aggregation result for a
   given batch.
1. Aggregators, or a passive network attacker between the Clients and the
   Leader, can examine metadata such as HTTP client IP in order to infer which
   Clients are submitting reports. Depending on the particulars of the
   deployment, this may be used to infer sensitive information about the Client.
   This can be mitigated for the Aggregator by deploying an anonymizing proxy
   (see {{anon-proxy}}), or in general by requiring Clients to submit reports at
   regular intervals independently of the measurement value such that the
   existence of a report does not imply the occurrence of a sensitive event.
1. Aggregators can deny service by refusing to respond to collection requests or
   aggregate share requests.
1. Some VDAFs could leak information to either Aggregator or the Collector
   beyond what the protocol intended to learn. It may be possible to mitigate
   such leakages using differential privacy ({{dp}}).

## Sybil Attacks {#sybil}

Several attacks on privacy or robustness involve malicious Clients uploading
reports that are valid under the chosen VDAF but incorrect.

For example, a DAP deployment might be measuring the heights of a human
population and configure a variant of Prio3 to prove that measurements are
values in the range of 80-250 cm. A malicious Client would not be able to claim
a height of 400 cm, but they could submit multiple bogus reports inside the
acceptable range, which would yield incorrect averages. More generally, DAP
deployments are susceptible to Sybil attacks {{Dou02}}, especially when carried
out by the Leader.

In this type of attack, the adversary adds to a batch a number of reports that
skew the aggregate result in its favor. For example, sending known measurements
to the Aggregators can allow a Collector to shrink the effective anonymity set
by subtracting the known measurements from the aggregate result. The result may
reveal additional information about the honest measurements, leading to a
privacy violation; or the result may have some property that is desirable to the
adversary ("stats poisoning").

Depending on the deployment and the specific threat being mitigated, there are
different ways to address Sybil attacks, such as:

1. Implementing Client authentication, as described in {{client-auth}}, likely
   paired with rate-limiting uploads from individual Clients.
1. Removing Client-specific metadata on individual reports, such as through the
   use of anonymizing proxies in the upload flow, as described in
   {{anon-proxy}}.
1. Some mechanisms for differential privacy ({{dp}}) can help mitigate Sybil
   attacks against privacy to some extent.

## Batch-selection Attacks {#batch-selection}

Depending on the batch mode, the privacy of an individual Client may be
infringed upon by selection of the batch. For example, in the leader-selected
batch mode, the Leader is free to select the reports that compose a given batch
almost arbitrarily; a malicious Leader might choose a batch composed of reports
arriving from a single client. The aggregate derived from this batch might then
reveal information about that Client.

The mitigations for this attack are similar to those used for Sybil attacks
({{sybil}}):

1. Implementing Client authentication, as described in {{client-auth}}, and
   having each aggregator verify that each batch contains reports from a
   suitable number of distinct clients.
1. Disassociating each report from the Client which generated it, via the use of
   anonymizing proxies ({{anon-proxy}}) or similar techniques.
1. Differential privacy ({{dp}}) can help mitigate the impact of this attack.
1. Deployment-specific mitigations may also be possible: for example, if every
   Client is sending reports at a given rate, it may be possible for aggregators
   to bound the accepted age of reports such that the number of aggregatable
   reports from a given Client is small enough to effectively mitigate this
   attack.

## Client Authentication {#client-auth}

In settings where it is practical for each Client to have an identity
provisioned (e.g., a user logged into a backend service or a hardware device
programmed with an identity), Client authentication can help Aggregators (or an
authenticating proxy deployed between Clients and the Aggregators; see
{{anon-proxy}}) ensure that all reports come from authentic Clients. Note that
because the Helper never handles messages directly from the Clients, reports
would need to include an extension ({{report-extensions}}) to convey
authentication information to the Helper. For example, a deployment might
include a Privacy Pass token ({{?I-D.draft-ietf-privacypass-architecture-16}})
in a report extension to allow both Aggregators to independently verify the
Client's identity.

However, in some deployments, it will not be practical to require Clients to
authenticate, so Client authentication is not mandatory in DAP. For example, a
widely distributed application that does not require its users to log in to any
service has no obvious way to authenticate its report uploads.

## Anonymizing Proxies {#anon-proxy}

Client reports may be transmitted alongside auxiliary information such as
source IP, HTTP user agent, or Client authentication information (in
deployments which use it, see {{client-auth}}). This metadata can be used by
Aggregators to identify participating Clients or permit some attacks on
robustness. This auxiliary information can be removed by having Clients submit
reports to an anonymizing proxy server which would then use Oblivious HTTP
{{!RFC9458}} to forward reports to the DAP Leader. In this scenario, Client
authentication would be performed by the proxy rather than any of the
participants in the DAP protocol.

The report itself may contain deanonmyizing information that cannot be removed
by a proxy:

* The report timestamp indicates when a report was generated and may help an
  attacker to deduce which Client generated it. Truncating this timestamp as
  described in {{timestamps}} can help.

* The public extensions may help the attacker to profile the Client's
  configuration.

## Differential Privacy {#dp}

DAP deployments can choose to ensure their aggregate results achieve
differential privacy ({{Vad16}}). A simple approach would require the
Aggregators to add two-sided noise (e.g. sampled from a two-sided geometric
distribution) to aggregate shares. Since each Aggregator is adding noise
independently, privacy can be guaranteed even if all but one of the Aggregators
is malicious. Differential privacy is a strong privacy definition, and protects
users in extreme circumstances: even if an adversary has prior knowledge of
every measurement in a batch except for one, that one measurement is still
formally protected.

## Task Parameters

Distribution of DAP task parameters is out of band from DAP itself and thus not
discussed in this document. This section examines the security tradeoffs
involved in the selection of the DAP task parameters. Generally, attacks
involving crafted DAP task parameters can be mitigated by having the Aggregators
refuse shared parameters that are trivially insecure (e.g., a minimum batch size
of 1 report).

### VDAF Verification Key Requirements {#verification-key}

Knowledge of the verification key would allow a Client to forge a report with
invalid values that will nevertheless pass verification. Therefore, the
verification key must be kept secret from Clients.

Furthermore, for a given report, it may be possible to craft a verification key
which leaks information about that report's measurement during VDAF preparation.
Therefore, the verification key for a task SHOULD be chosen before any reports
are generated. Moreover, it SHOULD be fixed for the lifetime of the task and not
be rotated. One way to ensure that the verification key is generated
independently from any given report is to derive the key based on the task ID
and some previously agreed upon secret (verify_key_seed) between Aggregators, as
follows:

~~~ pseudocode
verify_key = HKDF-Expand(
    HKDF-Extract(
        "verify_key",    # salt
        verify_key_seed, # IKM
    ),
    task_id,             # info
    VERIFY_KEY_SIZE,     # L
)
~~~

Here, VERIFY_KEY_SIZE is the length of the verification key, and HKDF-Extract
and HKDF-Expand are as defined in {{?RFC5869}}.

This requirement comes from current security analysis for existing VDAFs. In
particular, the security proofs for Prio3 require that the verification key is
chosen independently of the generated reports.

### Batch Parameters

An important parameter of a DAP deployment is the minimum batch size. If a batch
includes too few reports, then the aggregate result can reveal information
about individual measurements. Aggregators enforce the agreed-upon minimum
batch size during collection, but implementations SHOULD also opt out of
participating in a DAP task if the minimum batch size is too small. This
document does not specify how to choose an appropriate minimum batch size, but
an appropriate value may be determined from the differential privacy ({{dp}})
parameters in use, if any.

### Task Configuration Agreement and Consistency

In order to execute a DAP task, it is necessary for all parties to ensure they
agree on the configuration of the task. However, it is possible for a party to
participate in the execution of DAP without knowing all of the task's
parameters. For example, a Client can upload a report ({{upload-flow}}) without
knowing the minimum batch size that is enforced by the Aggregators during
collection ({{collect-flow}}).

Depending on the deployment model, agreement can require that task parameters
are visible to all parties such that each party can choose whether to
participate based on the value of any parameter. This includes the parameters
enumerated in {{task-configuration}} and any additional parameters implied by
report extensions {{report-extensions}} used by the task. Since meaningful
privacy requires that multiple Clients contribute to a task, they should also
share a consistent view of the task configuration.

## Infrastructure Diversity

DAP deployments should ensure that Aggregators do not have common dependencies
that would enable a single vendor to reassemble measurements. For example, if
all participating Aggregators stored unencrypted input shares on the same cloud
object storage service, then that cloud vendor would be able to reassemble all
the input shares and defeat privacy.

# IANA Considerations {#iana}

This document requests registry of new media types ({{iana-media-types}}),
creation of new codepoint registries ({{iana-codepoints}}), and registration of
an IETF URN sub-namespace ({{urn-space}}).

(RFC EDITOR: In the remainder of this section, replace "RFC XXXX" with the RFC
number assigned to this document.)

## Protocol Message Media Types {#iana-media-types}

This specification defines the following protocol messages, along with their
corresponding media types:

- HpkeConfigList {{hpke-config}}: "application/dap-hpke-config-list"
- Report {{upload-request}}: "application/dap-report"
- AggregationJobInitReq {{leader-init}}: "application/dap-aggregation-job-init-req"
- AggregationJobResp {{aggregation-helper-init}}: "application/dap-aggregation-job-resp"
- AggregationJobContinueReq {{aggregation-leader-continuation}}: "application/dap-aggregation-job-continue-req"
- AggregateShareReq {{collect-aggregate}}: "application/dap-aggregate-share-req"
- AggregateShare {{collect-aggregate}}: "application/dap-aggregate-share"
- CollectionJobReq {{collect-init}}: "application/dap-collection-job-req"
- CollectionJobResp {{collect-init}}: "application/dap-collection-job-resp"

Protocol message format evolution is supported through the definition of new
formats that are identified by new media types. The messages above are specific
to this specification. When a new major enhancement is proposed that results in
newer IETF specification for DAP, a new set of media types will be defined. In
other words, newer versions of DAP will not be backward compatible with this
version of DAP.

(RFC EDITOR: Remove this paragraph.) HTTP requests with DAP media types MAY
express an optional parameter 'version', following {{Section 8.3 of !RFC9110}}.
Value of this parameter indicates current draft version of the protocol the
component is using. This MAY be used as a hint by the receiver of the request
to do compatibility checks between client and server.
For example, A report submission to leader from a client that supports
draft-ietf-ppm-dap-09 could have the header
`Content-Type: application/dap-report;version=09`.

The "Media Types" registry at https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types will
be (RFC EDITOR: replace "will be" with "has been") updated to include each of
these media types. The information required for each media type is listed in
the remaining subsections.

## DAP Type Registries {#iana-codepoints}

This document also requests creation of a new "Distributed Aggregation Protocol
(DAP)" page. This page will contain several new registries, described in the
following sections. All registries are administered under the Specification
Required policy {{!RFC8126}}.

### Batch Modes Registry {#batch-mode-reg}

A new registry will be (RFC EDITOR: change "will be" to "has been") created
called "Batch Mode Identifiers" for DAP batch modes ({{batch-mode}}). This
registry should contain the following columns:

Value:
: The one-byte identifier for the batch mode

Name:
: The name of the batch mode

Reference:
: Where the batch mode is defined

The initial contents of this registry listed in {{batch-mode-id}}.

{: #upload-extension-id title="Initial contents of the Report Extension Identifiers registry."}

### Report Error Registry {#report-error-reg}

A new registry will be (RFC EDITOR: change "will be" to "has been") created
called "Report Error Identifiers" for reasons for rejecting reports during the
aggregation interaction ({{aggregation-helper-init}}).

## URN Sub-namespace for DAP (urn:ietf:params:ppm:dap) {#urn-space}

The following value will be (RFC EDITOR: change "will be" to "has been")
registered in the "IETF URN Sub-namespace for Registered Protocol
Parameter Identifiers" registry, following the template in {{!RFC3553}}:

~~~
Registry name:  dap

Specification:  RFC XXXX

Repository:  http://www.iana.org/assignments/dap

Index value:  No transformation needed.
~~~

The initial contents of this namespace are the types and descriptions in
{{urn-space-errors}}, with the Reference field set to RFC XXXX.

# Extending this Document {#extending-this-doc}

The behavior of DAP may be extended or modified by future documents defining
one or more of the following:

1. a new batch mode ({{batch-mode}})
1. a new report extension ({{report-extensions}})
1. a new report error ({{aggregation-helper-init}})
1. a new entry in the URN sub-namespace for DAP ({{urn-space-errors}})

Each of these requires registration of a codepoint or other value; see
{{iana}}. No other considerations are required except in the following cases:

* When a document defines a new batch mode, it MUST include a section titled
  "DAP Batch Mode Considerations" specifying the following:

    * The value of the `config` field of `Query`, `PartialBatchSelector`, and
      `BatchSelector`

    * Batch buckets ({{batch-buckets}}): how reports are assigned to batch
      buckets; how each bucket is identified; and how batch buckets are mapped to
      batches.

  See {{batch-modes}} for examples.

* When a document defines a new report extension, it SHOULD include in its
  "Security Considerations" section some discussion of how the extension
  impacts the security of DAP with respect to the threat model in
  {{sec-considerations}}.
