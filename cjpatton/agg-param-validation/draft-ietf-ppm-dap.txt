  Distributed Aggregation Protocol for Privacy Preserving Measurement
                       draft-ietf-ppm-dap-latest

Abstract

   There are many situations in which it is desirable to take
   measurements of data which people consider sensitive.  In these
   cases, the entity taking the measurement is usually not interested in
   people's individual responses but rather in aggregated data.
   Conventional methods require collecting individual responses and then
   aggregating them, thus representing a threat to user privacy and
   rendering many such measurements difficult and impractical.  This
   document describes a multi-party distributed aggregation protocol
   (DAP) for privacy preserving measurement (PPM) which can be used to
   collect aggregate data without revealing any individual user's data.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP)
   for privacy preserving measurement.  The protocol is executed by a
   large set of clients and two aggregation servers.  The aggregators'
   goal is to compute some aggregate statistic over measurements
   generated by clients without learning the measurements themselves.
   This is made possible by distributing the computation among the
   aggregators in such a way that, as long as at least one of them
   executes the protocol honestly, no measurement is ever seen in the
   clear by any aggregator.

1.1.  Change Log

   (RFC EDITOR: Remove this section.)

   (*) Indicates a change that breaks wire compatibility with the
   previous draft.

   13:

   *  Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-12 to 13 [VDAF] and adopt the streaming
      aggregation interface.  Accordingly, clarify that DAP is only
      compatible with VDAFs for which aggregation is order insensitive.

   *  Add public extensions to report metadata. (*)

   *  Improve extension points for batch modes. (*)

   *  During the upload interaction, allow the Leader to indicate to the
      Client which set of report extensions it doesn't support.

   *  Add a start time to task parameters and require rejection of
      reports outside of the time validity window.  Incidentally,
      replace the task end time with a task duration parameter.

   *  Clarify underspecified behavior around aggregation skew recovery.

   *  Improve IANA considerations and add guidelines for extending DAP.

   *  Rename "upload extension" to "report extension", and "prepare
      error" to "report error", to better align the names of these types
      with their functionality.

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-12" to "dap-13". (*)

   12:

   *  Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-08 to 12 [VDAF], and specify the newly-
      defined application context string to be a concatenation of the
      DAP version in use with the task ID. (*)

   *  Add support for "asynchronous" aggregation, based on the Leader
      polling the Helper for the result of each step of aggregation. (*)

   *  Update collection semantics to match the new aggregation semantics
      introduced in support of asynchronous aggregation. (*)

   *  Clarify the requirements around report replay protection, defining
      when and how report IDs must be checked and stored in order to
      correctly detect replays.

   *  Remove support for per-task HPKE configurations. (*)

   *  Rename "query type" to "batch mode", to align the name of this
      configuration value with its functionality.

   *  Rename the "fixed-size" batch mode to "leader-selected", to align
      the name with the behavior of this query type.

   *  Remove the max_batch_size parameter of the "fixed-size" batch
      mode.

   *  Restore the part_batch_selector field of the Collection structure,
      which was removed in draft 11, as it is required to decrypt
      collection results in some cases. (*)

   *  Update PrepareError allocations in order to remove an unused value
      and to reserve the zero value for testing. (*)

   *  Document distributed-system and synchronization concerns in the
      operational considerations section.

   *  Document additional storage and runtime requirements in the
      operational considerations section.

   *  Document deviations from the presentation language of Section 3 of
      [RFC8446] for structures described in this specification.

   *  Clarify that differential privacy mitigations can help with
      privacy, rather than robustness, in the operational considerations
      section.

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-11" to "dap-12". (*)

   11:

   *  Remove support for multi-collection of batches, as well as the
      fixed-size query type's by_batch_id query. (*)

   *  Clarify purpose of report ID uniqueness.

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-10" to "dap-11". (*)

   10:

   *  Editorial changes from httpdir early review.

   *  Poll collection jobs with HTTP GET instead of POST. (*)

   *  Upload reports with HTTP POST instead of PUT. (*)

   *  Clarify requirements for problem documents.

   *  Provide guidance on batch sizes when running VDAFs with non-
      trivial aggregation parameters.

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-09" to "dap-10". (*)

   09:

   *  Fixed-size queries: make the maximum batch size optional.

   *  Fixed-size queries: require current-batch queries to return
      distinct batches.

   *  Clarify requirements for compatible VDAFs.

   *  Clarify rules around creating and abandoning aggregation jobs.

   *  Recommend that all task parameters are visible to all parties.

   *  Revise security considerations section.

   *  Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-07 to 08 [VDAF]. (*)

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-07" to "dap-09". (*)

   08:

   *  Clarify requirements for initializing aggregation jobs.

   *  Add more considerations for Sybil attacks.

   *  Expand guidance around choosing the VDAF verification key.

   *  Add an error type registry for the aggregation sub-protocol.

   07:

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-06" to "dap-07".  This is a bug-fix
      revision: the editors overlooked some changes we intended to pick
      up in the previous version. (*)

   06:

   *  Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-06 to 07 [VDAF]. (*)

   *  Overhaul security considerations (#488).

   *  Adopt revised ping-pong interface in draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-07
      (#494).

   *  Add aggregation parameter to AggregateShareAad (#498). (*)

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-05" to "dap-06". (*)

   05:

   *  Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-05 to 06 [VDAF]. (*)

   *  Specialize the protocol for two-party VDAFs (i.e., one Leader and
      One Helper).  Accordingly, update the aggregation sub-protocol to
      use the new "ping-pong" interface for two-party VDAFs introduced
      in draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-06. (*)

   *  Allow the following actions to be safely retried: aggregation job
      creation, collection job creation, and requesting the Helper's
      aggregate share.

   *  Merge error types that are related.

   *  Drop recommendation to generate IDs using a cryptographically
      secure pseudorandom number generator wherever pseudorandomness is
      not required.

   *  Require HPKE config identifiers to be unique.

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-04" to "dap-05". (*)

   04:

   *  Introduce resource oriented HTTP API. (#278, #398, #400) (*)

   *  Clarify security requirements for choosing VDAF verify key. (#407,
      #411)

   *  Require Clients to provide nonce and random input when sharding
      inputs. (#394, #425) (*)

   *  Add interval of time spanned by constituent reports to Collection
      message. (#397, #403) (*)

   *  Update share validation requirements based on latest security
      analysis. (#408, #410)

   *  Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-03 to 05 [VDAF]. (#429) (*)

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-03" to "dap-04". (#424) (*)

   03:

   *  Enrich the "fixed_size" query type to allow the Collector to
      request a recently aggregated batch without knowing the batch ID
      in advance.  ID discovery was previously done out-of-band. (*)

   *  Allow Aggregators to advertise multiple HPKE configurations. (*)

   *  Clarify requirements for enforcing anti-replay.  Namely, while it
      is sufficient to detect repeated report IDs, it is also enough to
      detect repeated IDs and timestamps.

   *  Remove the extensions from the Report and add extensions to the
      plaintext payload of each ReportShare. (*)

   *  Clarify that extensions are mandatory to implement: If an
      Aggregator does not recognize a ReportShare's extension, it must
      reject it.

   *  Clarify that Aggregators must reject any ReportShare with repeated
      extension types.

   *  Specify explicitly how to serialize the Additional Authenticated
      Data (AAD) string for HPKE encryption.  This clarifies an
      ambiguity in the previous version. (*)

   *  Change the length tag for the aggregation parameter to 32 bits.
      (*)

   *  Use the same prefix ("application") for all media types. (*)

   *  Make input share validation more explicit, including adding a new
      ReportShareError variant, "report_too_early", for handling reports
      too far in the future. (*)

   *  Improve alignment of problem details usage with [RFC7807].
      Replace "reportTooLate" problem document type with
      "repjortRejected" and clarify handling of rejected reports in the
      upload sub-protocol. (*)

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-02" to "dap-03". (*)

   02:

   *  Define a new task configuration parameter, called the "query
      type", that allows tasks to partition reports into batches in
      different ways.  In the current draft, the Collector specifies a
      "query", which the Aggregators use to guide selection of the
      batch.  Two query types are defined: the "time_interval" type
      captures the semantics of draft 01; and the "fixed_size" type
      allows the Leader to partition the reports arbitrarily, subject to
      the constraint that each batch is roughly the same size. (*)

   *  Define a new task configuration parameter, called the task
      "expiration", that defines the lifetime of a given task.

   *  Specify requirements for HTTP request authentication rather than a
      concrete scheme.  (Draft 01 required the use of the DAP-Auth-Token
      header; this is now optional.)

   *  Make "task_id" an optional parameter of the "/hpke_config"
      endpoint.

   *  Add report count to CollectResp message. (*)

   *  Increase message payload sizes to accommodate VDAFs with input and
      aggregate shares larger than 2^16-1 bytes. (*)

   *  Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-01 to 03 [VDAF]. (*)

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-01" to "dap-02". (*)

   *  Rename the report nonce to the "report ID" and move it to the top
      of the structure. (*)

   *  Clarify when it is safe for an Aggregator to evict various data
      artifacts from long-term storage.

1.2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.1.  Glossary of Terms

   Aggregate result:  The output of the aggregation function.  As
      defined in [VDAF].

   Aggregate share:  A secret share of the aggregate result computed by
      each Aggregator and transmitted to the Collector.  As defined in
      [VDAF].

   Aggregation function:  The function computed over the measurements
      generated by the Clients and the aggregation parameter selected by
      the Collector.  As defined in [VDAF].

   Aggregation parameter:  Parameter selected by the Collector used to
      prepare a batch of measurements for aggregation.  As defined in
      [VDAF].

   Aggregator:  A server that receives report shares from Clients and
      validates and aggregates them with the help of the other
      Aggregator.  As defined in [VDAF].

   Batch:  A set of reports (i.e., measurements) that are aggregated
      into an aggregate result.  As defined in [VDAF].

   Batch bucket:  State associated with a given batch allowing the
      aggregators to perform incremental aggregation.  Depending on the
      batch mode, there may be many batch buckets tracking the state of
      a single batch.

   Batch duration:  The time difference between the oldest and newest
      report in a batch.

   Batch interval:  A parameter of a query issued by the Collector that
      specifies the time range of the reports in the batch.

   Client:  The DAP protocol role identifying a party that generates a
      measurement and uploads a report.  Note the distinction between a
      DAP Client (distinguished in this document by the capital "C") and
      an HTTP client (distinguished in this document by the phrase "HTTP
      client"), as the DAP Client is not the only role that sometimes
      acts as an HTTP client.

   Collector:  The party that selects the aggregation parameter and
      computes the aggregate result.

   Helper:  The Aggregator that executes the aggregation and collection
      interactions initiated by the Leader.

   Input share:  An Aggregator's share of a measurement.  The input
      shares are output by the VDAF sharding algorithm.  As defined in
      [VDAF].

   Output share:  An Aggregator's share of the refined measurement
      resulting from successful execution of VDAF preparation.  Many
      output shares are combined into an aggregate share during VDAF
      aggregation.  As defined in [VDAF].

   Leader:  The Aggregator that coordinates aggregation and collection
      with the Helper.

   Measurement:  A plaintext input emitted by a Client (e.g., a count,
      summand, or string), before any encryption or secret sharing is
      applied.  Depending on the VDAF in use, multiple values may be
      grouped into a single measurement.  As defined in [VDAF].

   Minimum batch size:  The minimum number of reports that must be
      aggregated before a batch can be collected.

   Public share:  The output of the VDAF sharding algorithm transmitted
      to each of the Aggregators.  As defined in [VDAF].

   Report:  A cryptographically protected measurement uploaded to the
      Leader by a Client.  Includes a pair of report shares, one for
      each Aggregator.

   Report share:  An input share encrypted under the HPKE public key of
      an Aggregator [HPKE].  The report share also includes some
      associated data used for processing the report.

1.3.  Representation Language

   With some exceptions, we use the presentation language defined in
   [RFC8446], Section 3 to define messages in the DAP protocol.
   Encoding and decoding of these messages as byte strings also follows
   [RFC8446].  We enumerate the exceptions below.

   Section 3.7 of [RFC8446] defines a syntax for structure fields whose
   values are constants.  In this document, we do not use that notation,
   but use something similar to describe specific variants of structures
   containing enumerated types, described in [RFC8446], Section 3.8.

   For example, suppose we have an enumeration and a structure defined
   as follows:

   enum {
     number(0),
     string(1),
     (255)
   } ExampleEnum;

   struct {
     uint32 always_present;
     ExampleEnum type;
     select (ExampleStruct.type) {
       case number: uint32 a_number;
       case string: opaque a_string<0..10>;
     };
   } ExampleStruct;

   Then we describe the specific variant of ExampleStruct where type ==
   number with a variant block as follows:

   variant {
     /* Field exists regardless of variant */
     uint32 always_present;
     ExampleEnum type = number;
     /* Only fields included in the `type == number`
        variant is described */
     uint32 a_number;
   } ExampleStruct;

   The protocol text accompanying this would explain how implementations
   should handle the always_present and a_number fields, but not the
   type field.  This does not mean that the type field of ExampleStruct
   can only ever have value number; it means only that it has this type
   in this instance.

   This notation can also be used in structures where the enum field
   does not affect what fields are or are not present in the structure.
   For example:

   enum {
     something(0),
     something_else(1),
     (255)
   } FailureReason;

   struct {
     FailureReason failure_reason;
     opaque another_field<0..256>;
   } FailedOperation;

   The protocol text might include a description like:

   variant {
     FailureReason failure_reason = something;
     opaque another_field<0..256>;
   } FailedOperation;

   Finally, by convention we do not specify the lower length limit of
   variable-length vectors.  Rather, the lower limit is always set to 0.

2.  Overview

   The protocol is executed by a large set of Clients and a pair of
   servers referred to as "Aggregators".  Each Client's input to the
   protocol is its measurement (or set of measurements, e.g., counts of
   some user behavior).  Given the input set of measurements meas_1,
   ..., meas_N held by the Clients, and an "aggregation parameter"
   agg_param shared by the Aggregators, the goal of DAP is to compute
   agg_result = F(agg_param, meas_1, ..., meas_N) for some function F
   while revealing nothing else about the measurements.  We call F the
   "aggregation function" and agg_result the "aggregate result".

   DAP is extensible in that it allows for the addition of new
   cryptographic schemes that compute different aggregation functions.
   In particular, the aggregation function is determined by the
   Verifiable Distributed Aggregation Function, or VDAF [VDAF], used to
   securely compute it.

   VDAFs rely on secret sharing to protect the privacy of the
   measurements.  Rather than sending its measurement in the clear, each
   Client shards its measurement into a pair of "input shares" and sends
   an input share to each of the Aggregators.  This scheme has two
   important properties:

   *  Given only one of the input shares, it is impossible to deduce the
      plaintext measurement from which it was generated.

   *  Aggregators can compute secret shares of the aggregate result by
      aggregating their shares locally into "aggregate shares", which
      may later be combined into the aggregate result.

   Note that some VDAFs allow measurements to be aggregated multiple
   times, each time with a different aggregation parameter; however, DAP
   only allows each measurement to be aggregated once.  Similarly, some
   VDAFs produce aggregate values which depend on the order in which the
   measurementas are aggregated; however, DAP only supports VDAFs whose
   aggregation results are independent of the order in which
   measurements are aggregated (see Section 4.4.1 of [VDAF]).

                       +------------+

          Figure 1: DAP architecture (who sends requests to whom).

   The main participants in the protocol are as follows:

   Collector:  The party which wants to obtain the aggregate result for
      the measurements generated by the Clients.  Any given measurement
      task will have a single Collector.

   Clients:  The parties which directly take the measurement(s) and
      report them to the DAP protocol.  In order to provide reasonable
      levels of privacy, there must be a large number of Clients.

   Leader:  The Aggregator responsible for coordinating the protocol.
      It receives the reports from Clients and aggregates them with the
      assistance of the Helper; and it orchestrates the process of
      computing the aggregate result as requested by the Collector.

   Helper:  The Aggregator assisting the Leader with the computation.
      The protocol is designed so that the Helper is relatively
      lightweight, with most of the operational burden borne by the
      Leader.

   The basic unit of DAP is the "task" which represents a single
   measurement process (though potentially aggregating multiple, non-
   overlapping batches of measurements).  The definition of a task
   includes the following parameters:

   *  The VDAF which determines the type of measurements and the
      aggregation function (e.g., mean, standard deviation, etc.).

   *  The identities of the Leader and Helper.  These are URLs that
      implement the APIs for uploading, aggregation, and collection
      specified in Section 4.

   *  Cryptographic assets involved in the computation (i.e., key
      material).

   *  Various parameters used to determine how reports are partitioned
      into batches and the size of each batch.

   These parameters are distributed to the Clients, Aggregators, and
   Collector before the task begins.  (Note that not all parameters are
   distributed to all parties.)  This document does not specify a
   distribution mechanism, but it is important that all protocol
   participants agree on the task's configuration.  Each task is
   identified by a unique 32-byte ID which is used to refer to it in
   protocol messages.

   During the lifetime of a task, each Client records its own
   measurement value(s), packages them up into a report, and sends them
   to the Leader.  Each share is separately encrypted for each
   Aggregator so that even though they pass through the Leader, the
   Leader is unable to see or modify them.  Depending on the task, the
   Client may only send one report or may send many reports over time.

   The Leader distributes the shares to the Helper and orchestrates the
   process of verifying them (see Section 2.2) and assembling them into
   a final aggregate result for the Collector.  Depending on the VDAF,
   it may be possible to incrementally process each report as it is
   uploaded, or it may be necessary to wait until the Collector
   transmits a collection request before processing can begin.

2.2.  Validating Measurements

   An essential task of any data collection pipeline is ensuring that
   the data being aggregated is "valid".  For example, if each
   measurement is expected to be an number between 0 and 10, then the
   aggregator should reject measurements larger than 10 or smaller than
   0.  In DAP, input validation is complicated by the fact that none of
   the entities other than the Client ever sees that Client's plaintext
   measurement.  To an Aggregator, a secret share of a valid measurement
   is indistinguishable from a secret share of an invalid measurement.

   In DAP, input validation is accomplished by an interactive
   computation between the Leader and Helper.  At the beginning of this
   computation, each Aggregator is in possession of an input share
   uploaded by the Client.  At the end of the computation, each
   Aggregator is in possession of either an "output share" that is ready
   to be aggregated or an indication that the underlying data is
   invalid, in which case the report is rejected.

   This process is known as "preparation" and is specified by the VDAF
   itself (Section 5.2 of [VDAF]).  To facilitate preparation, the
   report generated by the Client include information used by the
   Aggregators.  For example, Prio3 (Section 7 of [VDAF]) includes a
   zero-knowledge proof of the measurement's validity (Section 7.1 of
   [VDAF]); the process of verifying this proof reveals nothing about
   the underlying measurement beyond its validity.

   The specific properties attested to by the proof vary depending on
   the measurement being taken.  For instance, to measure the time the
   user took performing a given task the proof might demonstrate that
   the value reported was within a certain range (e.g., between 0 and 60
   seconds).  By contrast, to report which of a set of N options the
   user select, the report might contain N integers and the proof would
   demonstrate that N-1 were 0 and the other was 1.

   It is important to recognize that "validity" is distinct from
   "correctness".  For instance, the user might have spent 30 seconds on
   a task but the Client might report 60 seconds.  This is a problem
   with any measurement system and DAP does not attempt to address it;
   it merely ensures that the data is within acceptable limits, so the
   Client could not report 10^6 or -20 seconds.

2.3.  Replay Protection

   Another goal of DAP is to mitigate replay attacks in which a report
   is aggregated multiple times within a batch or across multiple
   batches.  This would allow the attacker to learn more information
   about the underlying measurement than it would otherwise.

   When a Client generates a report, it also generates a random nonce,
   called the "report ID".  Each Aggregator is responsible for storing
   the IDs of reports it has aggregated for a given task.  To check
   whether a report has been replayed, it checks whether the report's ID
   is in the set of stored IDs.

   Note that IDs do not need to be stored indefinitely.  The protocol
   allows Aggregators to enforce replay only for a sliding time window
   (e.g., within the last two weeks of the current time) and reject
   reports that fall outside of the replay window.  This allows
   implementation to save resources by forgetting old report IDs.

3.  Message Transport

   Communications between DAP participants are carried over HTTP
   [RFC9110].  Use of HTTPS is REQUIRED to provide server authentication
   and confidentiality.

3.1.  HTTPS Request Authentication

   DAP is made up of several interactions in which different subsets of
   the protocol's participants interact with each other.

   In those cases where a channel between two participants is tunneled
   through another protocol participant, DAP mandates the use of public-
   key encryption using [HPKE] to ensure that only the intended
   recipient can see a message in the clear.

   In other cases, DAP requires HTTP client authentication as well as
   server authentication.  Any authentication scheme that is composable
   with HTTP is allowed.  For example:

   *  [OAuth2] credentials are presented in an Authorization HTTP
      header, which can be added to any DAP protocol message.

   *  TLS client certificates can be used to authenticate the underlying
      transport.

   *  The DAP-Auth-Token HTTP header described in
      [I-D.draft-dcook-ppm-dap-interop-test-design-04].

   This flexibility allows organizations deploying DAP to use existing
   well-known HTTP authentication mechanisms that they already support.
   Discovering what authentication mechanisms are supported by a DAP
   participant is outside of this document's scope.

3.2.  Errors

   Errors can be reported in DAP both as HTTP status codes and as
   problem detail objects [RFC9457] in the response body.  For example,
   if the HTTP client sends a request using a method not allowed in this
   document, then the server MAY return HTTP status 405 Method Not
   Allowed.

   When the server responds with an error status code, it SHOULD provide
   additional information using a problem detail object.  If the
   response body does consist of a problem detail object, the HTTP
   status code MUST indicate a client or server error (the 4xx or 5xx
   classes, respectively, from Section 15 of [RFC9110]).

   To facilitate automatic response to errors, this document defines the
   following standard tokens for use in the "type" field:

    +=============================+==================================+
    | Type                        | Description                      |

    +-----------------------------+----------------------------------+

                                 Table 1

   This list is not exhaustive.  The server MAY return errors set to a
   URI other than those defined above.  Servers MUST NOT use the DAP URN
   namespace for errors not listed in the appropriate IANA registry (see
   Section 9.3).  The "detail" member of the Problem Details document
   includes additional diagnostic information.

   When the task ID is known (see Section 4.3), the problem document
   SHOULD include an additional "taskid" member containing the ID
   encoded in Base 64 using the URL and filename safe alphabet with no
   padding defined in Sections 5 and 3.2 of [RFC4648].

   In the remainder of this document, the tokens in the table above are
   used to refer to error types, rather than the full URNs.  For
   example, an "error of type 'invalidMessage'" refers to an error
   document with "type" value
   "urn:ietf:params:ppm:dap:error:invalidMessage".

   This document uses the verbs "abort" and "alert with [some error
   message]" to describe how protocol participants react to various
   error conditions.  This implies HTTP status code 400 Bad Request
   unless explicitly specified otherwise.

4.  Protocol Definition

   DAP has three major interactions which need to be defined:

   *  Uploading reports from the Client to the Aggregators, specified in
      Section 4.7

   *  Computing the results for a given measurement task, specified in
      Section 4.8

   *  Collecting aggregated results, specified in Section 4.9

   Each of these interactions is defined in terms of "resources".  In
   this section we define these resources and the messages used to act
   on them.

4.1.  Basic Type Definitions

   The following are some basic type definitions used in other messages:

   /* ASCII encoded URL. e.g., "https://example.com" */
   opaque Url<0..2^16-1>;

   uint64 Duration; /* Number of seconds elapsed between two instants */

   uint64 Time; /* seconds elapsed since start of UNIX epoch */

   /* An interval of time of length duration, where start is included
     and (start + duration) is excluded. */
   struct {
     Time start;
     Duration duration;
   } Interval;

   /* An ID used to uniquely identify a report in the context of a
      DAP task. */
   opaque ReportID[16];

   /* The various roles in the DAP protocol. */
   enum {
     collector(0),
     client(1),
     leader(2),
     helper(3),
     (255)
   } Role;

   /* Identifier for a server's HPKE configuration */
   uint8 HpkeConfigId;

   /* An HPKE ciphertext. */
   struct {
     HpkeConfigId config_id;    /* config ID */
     opaque enc<0..2^16-1>;     /* encapsulated HPKE key */
     opaque payload<0..2^32-1>; /* ciphertext */
   } HpkeCiphertext;

   /* Represent a zero-length byte string. */
   struct {} Empty;

   DAP uses the 16-byte ReportID as the nonce parameter for the VDAF
   shard and prep_init methods (see [VDAF], Section 5).  Additionally,
   DAP includes messages defined in the VDAF specification encoded as
   opaque byte strings within various DAP messages.  Thus, for a VDAF to
   be compatible with DAP, it MUST specify a NONCE_SIZE of 16 bytes, and
   MUST specify encodings for the following VDAF types:

   *  PublicShare

   *  InputShare

   *  AggParam

   *  AggShare

   *  PrepShare

   *  PrepMessage

4.2.  Batch Modes, Batches, and Queries

   An aggregate result is computed from a set of reports, called a
   "batch".  The Collector requests the aggregate result by making a
   "query"; the Aggregators use this query to select a batch for
   aggregation.

   Each measurement task has a preconfigured "batch mode".  The batch
   mode defines both how reports may be partitioned into batches, as
   well as how these batches are addressed and the semantics of the
   query used for collection.

   This document defines two batch modes:

   *  time-interval (Section 5.1) in which the query specifies a time
      interval, and the batch consists of all reports with a timestamp
      in that interval.

   *  leader-selected (Section 5.2) in which the Leader assigns reports
      to batches itself, and the Collector's query simply requests the
      aggregate result for the "next" batch of reports.

   Future documents may define additional batch modes for DAP; see
   Section 10.  Implementations are free to implement only a subset of
   the available batch modes.

   Batch modes are identified with a single byte in serialized messages,
   as follows:

   enum {
     reserved(0),
     (255)
   } BatchMode;

   The query is issued to the Leader by the Collector during the
   collection interaction (Section 4.9).  In addition, information used
   to guide batch selection is conveyed from the Leader to the Helper
   when initializing aggregation (Section 4.8) and finalizing the
   aggregate shares.

4.3.  Task Configuration

   Prior to the start of execution of the protocol, each participant
   must agree on the configuration for each task.  A task is uniquely
   identified by its task ID:

   opaque TaskID[32];

   The task ID value MUST be a globally unique sequence of bytes.  Each
   task has the following parameters associated with it:

   *  leader_aggregator_url: A URL relative to which the Leader's API
      resources can be found.

   *  helper_aggregator_url: A URL relative to which the Helper's API
      resources can be found.

   *  The batch mode for this task (see Section 4.2).  This determines
      how reports are grouped into batches and the properties that all
      batches for this task must have.  The party MUST NOT configure the
      task if it does not recognize the batch mode.

   *  task_start: The time from which the Clients will start uploading
      reports to a task.  Aggregators MUST reject reports with
      timestamps earlier than task_start as described in
      Section 4.8.1.4.

   *  task_duration: The duration of a task.  The task is considered
      completed after the end time task_start + task_duration.
      Aggregators MUST reject reports that have timestamps later than
      the end time, and MAY choose to opt out of the task if
      task_duration is too long.

   *  time_precision: Used to compute timestamps in DAP.  See
      Section 4.5.

   *  A unique identifier for the VDAF in use for the task, e.g., one of
      the VDAFs defined in Section 10 of [VDAF].

   *  min_batch_size: The smallest number of reports the batch is
      allowed to include.  In a sense, this parameter controls the
      degree of privacy that will be obtained: the larger the minimum
      batch size, the higher degree of privacy.  However, this
      ultimately depends on the application and the nature of the
      measurements and aggregation function.

   Note that the leader_aggregator_url and helper_aggregator_url values
   may include arbitrary path components.

   In addition, in order to facilitate the aggregation and collection
   interactions, each of the Aggregators is configured with following
   parameters:

   *  collector_hpke_config: The [HPKE] configuration of the Collector
      (described in Section 4.7.1); see Section 7 for information about
      the HPKE configuration algorithms.

   *  vdaf_verify_key: The VDAF verification key shared by the
      Aggregators.  This key is used in the aggregation interaction
      (Section 4.8).  The security requirements are described in
      Section 8.6.1.

   Finally, the Collector is configured with the HPKE secret key
   corresponding to collector_hpke_config.

   A task's parameters are immutable for the lifetime of that task.  The
   only way to change parameters or to rotate secret values like
   collector HPKE configuration or the VDAF verification key is to
   configure a new task.

4.4.  Resource URIs

   DAP is defined in terms of "resources", such as reports
   (Section 4.7), aggregation jobs (Section 4.8), and collection jobs
   (Section 4.9).  Each resource has an associated URI.  Resource URIs
   are specified by a sequence of string literals and variables.
   Variables are expanded into strings according to the following rules:

   *  Variables {leader} and {helper} are replaced with the base URL of
      the Leader and Helper respectively (the base URL is defined in
      Section 4.3).

   *  Variables {task-id}, {aggregation-job-id}, and {collection-job-id}
      are replaced with the task ID (Section 4.3), aggregation job ID
      (Section 4.8.1), and collection job ID (Section 4.9.1)
      respectively.  The value MUST be encoded in its URL-safe, unpadded
      Base 64 representation as specified in Sections 5 and 3.2 of
      [RFC4648].

   For example, given a helper URL "https://example.com/api/dap", task
   ID "f0 16 34 47 36 4c cf 1b c0 e3 af fc ca 68 73 c9 c3 81 f6 4a cd f9
   02 06 62 f8 3f 46 c0 72 19 e7" and an aggregation job ID "95 ce da 51
   e1 a9 75 23 68 b0 d9 61 f9 46 61 28" (32 and 16 byte octet strings,
   represented in hexadecimal), resource URI {helper}/tasks/{task-
   id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id} would be expanded into
   https://example.com/api/dap/tasks/8BY0RzZMzxvA46_8ymhzycOB9krN-
   QIGYvg_RsByGec/aggregation_jobs/lc7aUeGpdSNosNlh-UZhKA.

4.5.  Timestamps and Time Intervals

   DAP uses timestamps in various places:

   *  The task configuration includes a validity interval (Section 4.3).
      The interval includes a timestamp indicating when the interval
      begins.

   *  The Client's report includes a timestamp indicating when the
      report was generated (Section 4.7).

   *  The Collector's query may specify a time interval for reports it
      wants to aggregate (Section 5.1).

   *  The result of a collection job indicates the range of timestamps
      of reports included in the aggregate result (Section 4.9).

   A timestamp has type Time and its value is the number of seconds
   since the UNIX epoch.  In addition, every timestamp MUST be rounded
   down to the nearest multiple of time_precision (Section 4.3).  That
   is, the value is computed as

   sent_timestamp = timestamp - (timestamp % time_precision)

   A received timestamp is considered to be malformed if
   received_timestamp % time_precision > 0.

   A time interval has type Interval and consists of a timestamp
   indicating the start of the interval and a duration.  The duration
   has type Duration and its value is a number of seconds.  The duration
   MUST be a multiple of time_precision: if duration % time_precision >
   0, then the interval is considered to be malformed.

   Truncating timestamps has multiple purposes.  Clients truncate their
   report timestamp in order to avoid reducing the size of the anonymity
   set; see Section 8.4.  It also helps Aggregators manage resources;
   see Section 6.4.1.

4.6.  Aggregation Parameter Validation

   For each batch it collects, the Collector assigns an aggregation
   parameter used to refine the measurements before aggregating them.
   The aggregation parameter is subject to a validation procedure
   specified by the VDAF.

   Before accepting a collection job from the Collector (Section 4.9.1),
   the Leader checks that the indicated aggregation parameter,
   agg_param, is valid according to the following procedure.  The Helper
   does the same before accepting an aggregation job from the Leader
   (Section 4.8.1.2).

   1.  Decode the byte string agg_param into an AggParam as specified by
       the VDAF.  (VDAFs compatible with this specification MUST specify
       an encoding of the aggregation parameter as a byte string; see
       Section 4.1.)  If decoding fails, then the aggregation parameter
       is invalid.

   2.  Run vdaf.is_valid(decoded_agg_param, []), where decoded_agg_param
       is the decoded AggParam and is_valid() is as defined in
       Section 5.3 of [VDAF].  If the output is not True, then the
       aggregation parameter is invalid.

   If both steps succeed, then the aggregation parameter is deemed to be
   valid.

4.7.  Uploading Reports

   Clients periodically upload reports to the Leader.  Each report
   contains two "report shares", one for the Leader and another for the
   Helper.  The Helper's report share is transmitted by the Leader
   during the aggregation interaction (see Section 4.8).

4.7.1.  HPKE Configuration Request

   Before the Client can upload its report to the Leader, it must know
   the HPKE configuration of each Aggregator.  See Section 7 for
   information on HPKE algorithm choices.

   Clients retrieve the HPKE configuration from each Aggregator by
   sending an HTTP GET request to {aggregator}/hpke_config.

   An Aggregator responds to well-formed requests with HTTP status code
   200 OK and an HpkeConfigList value, with media type "application/dap-
   hpke-config-list".  The HpkeConfigList structure contains one or more
   HpkeConfig structures in decreasing order of preference.  This allows
   an Aggregator to support multiple HPKE configurations simultaneously.

   HpkeConfig HpkeConfigList<0..2^16-1>;

   struct {
     HpkeConfigId id;
     HpkeKemId kem_id;
     HpkeKdfId kdf_id;
     HpkeAeadId aead_id;
     HpkePublicKey public_key;
   } HpkeConfig;

   opaque HpkePublicKey<0..2^16-1>;
   uint16 HpkeAeadId; /* Defined in [HPKE] */
   uint16 HpkeKemId;  /* Defined in [HPKE] */
   uint16 HpkeKdfId;  /* Defined in [HPKE] */

   Aggregators MUST allocate distinct id values for each HpkeConfig in
   an HpkeConfigList.

   The Client MUST abort if any of the following happen for any HPKE
   config request:

   *  the GET request did not return a valid HPKE config list;

   *  the HPKE config list is empty; or

   *  no HPKE config advertised by the Aggregator specifies a supported
      a KEM, KDF, or AEAD algorithm triple.

   Aggregators SHOULD use HTTP caching to permit client-side caching of
   this resource [RFC5861].  Aggregators SHOULD favor long cache
   lifetimes to avoid frequent cache revalidation, e.g., on the order of
   days.  Aggregators can control this cached lifetime with the Cache-
   Control header, as in this example:

     Cache-Control: max-age=86400

   Servers should choose a max-age value appropriate to the lifetime of
   their keys.  Clients SHOULD follow the usual HTTP caching [RFC9111]
   semantics for HPKE configurations.

   Note: Long cache lifetimes may result in Clients using stale HPKE
   configurations; Aggregators SHOULD continue to accept reports with
   old keys for at least twice the cache lifetime in order to avoid
   rejecting reports.

4.7.2.  Upload Request

   Clients upload reports by using an HTTP POST to {leader}/tasks/{task-
   id}/reports.  The payload is a Report, with media type "application/
   dap-report", structured as follows:

   struct {
     ReportID report_id;
     Time time;
     Extension public_extensions<0..2^16-1>;
   } ReportMetadata;

   struct {
     ReportMetadata report_metadata;
     opaque public_share<0..2^32-1>;
     HpkeCiphertext leader_encrypted_input_share;
     HpkeCiphertext helper_encrypted_input_share;
   } Report;

   *  report_metadata is public metadata describing the report.

      -  report_id is used by the Aggregators to ensure the report is
         not replayed (Figure 2).  The Client MUST generate this by
         generating 16 random bytes using a cryptographically secure
         random number generator.

      -  time is the time at which the report was generated.  The Client
         MUST truncate their timestamp as described in Section 4.5.

      -  public_extensions is the list of public report extensions; see
         Section 4.7.3.

   *  public_share is the public share output by the VDAF sharding
      algorithm.  Note that the public share might be empty, depending
      on the VDAF.

   *  leader_encrypted_input_share is the Leader's encrypted input
      share.

   *  helper_encrypted_input_share is the Helper's encrypted input
      share.

   Aggregators MAY require Clients to authenticate when uploading
   reports (see Section 8.3).  If it is used, HTTP client authentication
   MUST use a scheme that meets the requirements in Section 3.1.

   The handling of the upload request by the Leader MUST be idempotent
   as discussed in Section 9.2.2 of [RFC9110].

   To generate a report, the Client begins by sharding its measurement
   into input shares and the public share using the VDAF's sharding
   algorithm (Section 5.1 of [VDAF]), using the report ID as the nonce:

   (public_share, input_shares) = Vdaf.shard(
       "dap-13" || task_id,
       measurement, /* plaintext measurement */
       report_id,   /* nonce */
       rand,        /* randomness for sharding algorithm */
   )

   where task_id is the task ID.  The last input comprises the
   randomness consumed by the sharding algorithm.  The sharding
   randomness is a random byte string of length specified by the VDAF.
   The Client MUST generate this using a cryptographically secure random
   number generator.

   The sharding algorithm will return two input shares.  The first input
   share returned from the sharding algorithm is considered to be the
   Leader's input share, and the second input share is considered to be
   the Helper's input share.

   The Client then wraps each input share in the following structure:

   struct {
     Extension private_extensions<0..2^16-1>;
     opaque payload<0..2^32-1>;
   } PlaintextInputShare;

   Field private_extensions is set to the list of private report
   extensions intended to be consumed by the given Aggregator.  (See
   Section 4.7.3.)  Field payload is set to the Aggregator's input share
   output by the VDAF sharding algorithm.

   Next, the Client encrypts each PlaintextInputShare
   plaintext_input_share as follows:

   enc, payload = SealBase(pk,
     "dap-13 input share" || 0x01 || server_role,
     input_share_aad, plaintext_input_share)

   where pk is the Aggregator's public key; 0x01 represents the Role of
   the sender (always the Client); server_role is the Role of the
   intended recipient (0x02 for the Leader and 0x03 for the Helper),
   plaintext_input_share is the Aggregator's PlaintextInputShare, and
   input_share_aad is an encoded message of type InputShareAad defined
   below, constructed from the same values as the corresponding fields
   in the report.  The SealBase() function is as specified in [HPKE],
   Section 6.1 for the ciphersuite indicated by the HPKE configuration.

   struct {
     TaskID task_id;
     ReportMetadata report_metadata;
     opaque public_share<0..2^32-1>;
   } InputShareAad;

   The Leader responds to well-formed requests with HTTP status code 201
   Created.  Malformed requests are handled as described in Section 3.2.
   Clients SHOULD NOT upload the same measurement value in more than one
   report if the Leader responds with HTTP status code 201 Created.

   If the Leader does not recognize the task ID, then it MUST abort with
   error unrecognizedTask.  Note that indicating an unrecognized task
   might indicate that the Client is misconfigured or the task has
   expired.

   The Leader responds to requests whose Leader encrypted input share
   uses an out-of-date or unknown HpkeConfig.id value, indicated by
   HpkeCiphertext.config_id, with error of type 'outdatedConfig'.  When
   the Client receives an 'outdatedConfig' error, it SHOULD invalidate
   any cached HpkeConfigList and retry with a freshly generated Report.
   If this retried upload does not succeed, the Client SHOULD abort and
   discontinue retrying.

   If a report's ID matches that of a previously uploaded report, the
   Leader MUST ignore it.  In addition, it MAY alert the Client with
   error reportRejected.

   The Leader MUST ignore any report pertaining to a batch that has
   already been collected (see Section 4.8.1.4 for details).  Otherwise,
   comparing the aggregate result to the previous aggregate result may
   result in a privacy violation.  Note that this is also enforced by
   the Helper during the aggregation interaction.  The Leader MAY also
   abort the upload interaction and alert the Client with error
   reportRejected.

   The Leader MUST ignore any report whose timestamp is before the
   task's task_start, or is past the end time task_start +
   task_duration.  When it does so, it SHOULD also abort the upload
   interaction and alert the Client with error reportRejected.  Clients
   MUST NOT upload a report if its timestamp would be earlier than
   task_start or later than task_start + task_duration.

   The Leader may need to buffer reports while waiting to aggregate them
   (e.g., while waiting for an aggregation parameter from the Collector;
   see Section 4.9).  The Leader SHOULD NOT accept reports whose
   timestamps are too far in the future.  Implementors MAY provide for
   some small leeway, usually no more than a few minutes, to account for
   clock skew.  If the Leader rejects a report for this reason, it
   SHOULD abort the upload interaction and alert the Client with error
   reportTooEarly.  In this situation, the Client MAY re-upload the
   report later on.

   If the report contains an unrecognized public report extension, or if
   the Leader's input share contains an unrecognized private report
   extension, then the Leader MAY abort the upload request with error
   "unsupportedExtension."  If the Leader does abort for this reason, it
   MAY indicate the unsupported extensions in the resulting problem
   document via an extension member (Section 3.2 of [RFC9457])
   "unsupported_extensions" on the problem document; this member MUST
   contain an array of numeric values indicating the extension code
   points which were not recognized.  For example, if the report upload
   contained two unsupported extensions with code points 23 and 42, the
   "unsupported_extensions" member would contain the value [23, 42].

   If the same extension type appears more than once among the public
   extensions and the private extensions in the Leader's input share,
   then the Leader MAY abort the upload request with error
   "invalidMessage".

   (Note that validation of extensions is not mandatory here because it
   requires the Leader to decrypt its input share.  The Leader also
   cannot validate the Helper's extensions because it cannot decrypt the
   Helper's input share.  Mandatory validation of extensions will occur
   during aggregation.)

4.7.3.  Report Extensions

   Each ReportMetadata contains a list of extensions public to both
   aggregators, and each PlaintextInputShare contains a list of
   extensions private to the relevant Aggregator.  Clients use these
   extensions to convey additional information to the Aggregators.  Some
   extensions might be intended for both Aggregators; others may only be
   intended for a specific Aggregator.  (For example, a DAP deployment
   might use some out-of-band mechanism for an Aggregator to verify that
   reports come from authenticated Clients.  It will likely be useful to
   bind the extension to the input share via HPKE encryption.)

   Each extension is a tag-length encoded value of the following form:

   struct {
     ExtensionType extension_type;
     opaque extension_data<0..2^16-1>;
   } Extension;

   enum {
     reserved(0),
     (65535)
   } ExtensionType;

   Field "extension_type" indicates the type of extension, and
   "extension_data" contains information specific to the extension.

   Extensions are mandatory-to-implement: If an Aggregator receives a
   report containing an extension it does not recognize, then it MUST
   reject the report.  (See Section 4.8.1.4 for details.)

4.8.  Verifying and Aggregating Reports

   Once a set of Clients have uploaded their reports to the Leader, the
   Leader can begin the process of validating and aggregating them with
   the Helper.  To enable the system to handle large batches of reports,
   this process can be parallelized across many "aggregation jobs" in
   which small subsets of the reports are processed independently.  Each
   aggregation job is associated with exactly one DAP task, but a task
   can have many aggregation jobs.

   The primary objective of an aggregation job is to run the VDAF
   preparation process described in [VDAF], Section 5.2 for each report
   in the job.  Preparation has two purposes:

   1.  To "refine" the input shares into "output shares" that have the
       desired aggregatable form.  For some VDAFs, like Prio3, the
       mapping from input to output shares is a fixed operation
       depending only on the input share, but in general the mapping
       involves an aggregation parameter chosen by the Collector.

   2.  To verify that the output shares, when combined, correspond to a
       valid, refined measurement, where validity is determined by the
       VDAF itself.  For example, the Prio3Sum variant of Prio3
       (Section 7.4.2 of [VDAF]) requires that the output shares sum up
       to an integer in a specific range, while the Prio3Histogram
       variant (Section 7.4.4 of [VDAF]) proves that output shares sum
       up to a one-hot vector representing a contribution to a single
       bucket of the histogram.

   In general, refinement and verification are not distinct
   computations, since for some VDAFs, verification may only be achieved
   implicitly as a result of the refinement process.  We instead think
   of these as properties of the output shares themselves: if
   preparation succeeds, then the resulting output shares are guaranteed
   to combine into a valid, refined measurement.

   VDAF preparation is mapped onto an aggregation job as illustrated in
   Figure 2.  The protocol is comprised of a sequence of HTTP requests
   from the Leader to the Helper, the first of which includes the
   aggregation parameter, the Helper's report share for each report in
   the job, and for each report the initialization step for preparation.
   The Helper's response, along with each subsequent request and
   response, carries the remaining messages exchanged during
   preparation.

     leader_out_share                         helper_out_share

           Figure 2: Overview of the DAP aggregation interaction.

   The number of steps, and the type of the responses, depends on the
   VDAF.  The message structures and processing rules are specified in
   the following subsections.

   Normally, the Helper processes each step synchronously, meaning it
   computes each step of the computation before producing a response to
   the Leader's HTTP request.  The Helper can optionally instead process
   each step asynchronously, meaning the Helper responds to requests
   immediately, while deferring processing to a background worker.  To
   continue, the Leader polls the Helper until it responds with the next
   step.  This choice allows a Helper implementation flexibility in
   choosing a request model that best supports its architecture and use
   case.  For instance, resource-intensive use cases, such as replay
   checks across vast numbers of reports and preparation of large
   histograms, may be better suited for the asynchronous model.  For use
   cases where datastore performance is a concern, the synchronous model
   may be better suited.

   In general, aggregation cannot begin until the Collector specifies a
   query and an aggregation parameter.  However, depending on the VDAF
   and batch mode in use, it is often possible to begin aggregation as
   soon as reports arrive.  For example, Prio3 has just one valid
   aggregation parameter (the empty string), and thus allows for eager
   aggregation; and both the time-interval (Section 5.1) and leader-
   selected (Section 5.2) batch modes defined in this document allow for
   eager aggregation.

   An aggregation job can be thought of as having three phases, which
   are described in the remaining subsections:

   *  Initialization: Begin the aggregation flow by disseminating report
      shares and initializing the VDAF prep state for each report.

   *  Continuation: Continue the aggregation flow by exchanging prep
      shares and messages until preparation completes or an error
      occurs.

   *  Completion: Finish the aggregation flow, yielding an output share
      corresponding to each report share in the aggregation job, and
      update the appropriate aggregate shares with these output shares.

   After an aggregation job is completed, each Aggregator updates
   running-total aggregate shares and other values for each "batch
   bucket" associated with a recovered output share, as described in
   Section 4.8.2.3.  These values are stored until the batch is
   collected as described in Section 4.9.

   Apart from VDAF preparation, another important task of the
   aggregation interaction is to provide replay protection
   (Section 2.3).  Along with the output shares, each Aggregator records
   the IDs of all reports it is has aggregated for a given task: before
   committing to an output share, it checks whether the corresponding
   report ID is in the set of stored IDs.

4.8.1.  Aggregate Initialization

   The Leader begins an aggregation job by choosing a set of candidate
   reports that pertain to the same DAP task and a job ID which MUST be
   unique within the scope of the task.  The job ID is a 16-byte value,
   structured as follows:

   opaque AggregationJobID[16];

   The Leader can run this process for many sets of candidate reports in
   parallel as needed.  After choosing a set of candidates, the Leader
   begins aggregation by splitting each report into report shares, one
   for each Aggregator.  The Leader and Helper then run the aggregate
   initialization flow to accomplish two tasks:

   1.  Recover and determine which input report shares are valid.

   2.  For each valid report share, initialize the VDAF preparation
       process (see Section 5.2 of [VDAF]).

   The Leader and Helper initialization behavior is detailed below.

   Implementation note: the Leader will generally want to associate each
   report with a single aggregation job, as otherwise the duplicated
   reports will eventually be discarded as a replay.  However, it is
   likely not appropriate to directly use the used-ID storage used for
   replay protection to determine which reports can be added to an
   aggregation job: certain errors (e.g. report_too_early) allow the
   report to be added to another aggregation job in the future; but
   storage into the used-ID storage is permanent.

4.8.1.1.  Leader Initialization

   The Leader begins the aggregate initialization by sampling a fresh
   AggregationJobID.

   Next, for each report in the candidate set, it checks if the report
   ID corresponds to a report ID it has previously stored for this task.
   If so, it marks the report as invalid and removes it from the
   candidate set.

   Next, the Leader decrypts each of its report shares as described in
   Section 4.8.1.3, then checks input share validity as described in
   Section 4.8.1.4.  If either step invalidates the report, the Leader
   rejects the report and removes it from the set of candidate reports.

   Next, for each report the Leader executes the following procedure:

   (state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_init(
       vdaf_verify_key,
       "dap-13" || task_id,
       agg_param,
       report_id,
       public_share,
       plaintext_input_share.payload)

   where:

   *  vdaf_verify_key is the VDAF verification key for the task

   *  task_id is the task ID

   *  agg_param is the VDAF aggregation parameter provided by the
      Collector (see Section 4.9)

   *  report_id is the report ID, used as the nonce for VDAF sharding

   *  public_share is the report's public share

   *  plaintext_input_share is the Leader's PlaintextInputShare

   The methods are defined in Section 5.8 of [VDAF].  This process
   determines the initial per-report state, as well as the initial
   outbound message to send to the Helper.  If state is of type
   Rejected, then the report is rejected and removed from the set of
   candidate reports, and no message is sent to the Helper.

   If state is of type Continued, then the Leader constructs a
   PrepareInit message structured as follows:

   struct {
     ReportMetadata report_metadata;
     opaque public_share<0..2^32-1>;
     HpkeCiphertext encrypted_input_share;
   } ReportShare;

   struct {
     ReportShare report_share;
     opaque payload<0..2^32-1>;
   } PrepareInit;

   Each of these messages is constructed as follows:

   *  report_share.report_metadata is the report's metadata.

   *  report_share.public_share is the report's public share.

   *  report_share.encrypted_input_share is the Helper's encrypted input
      share.

   *  payload is set to the outbound message computed by the previous
      step.

   It is not possible for state to be of type Finished during Leader
   initialization.

   Once all the report shares have been initialized, the Leader creates
   an AggregationJobInitReq message structured as follows:

   opaque BatchID[32];

   struct {
     BatchMode batch_mode;
     opaque config<0..2^16-1>;
   } PartialBatchSelector;

   struct {
     opaque agg_param<0..2^32-1>;
     PartialBatchSelector part_batch_selector;
     PrepareInit prepare_inits<0..2^32-1>;
   } AggregationJobInitReq;

   This message consists of:

   *  agg_param: The VDAF aggregation parameter chosne by the Collector.
      Before initializing an aggregation job, the Leader MUST validate
      the parameter as described in Section 4.6.

   *  part_batch_selector: The "partial batch selector" used by the
      Aggregators to determine how to aggregate each report.  Its
      contents depends on the indicated batch mode: for time-interval
      mode, the config field is empty (Section 5.1); for leader-selected
      tasks, the Leader specifies a "batch ID" that determines the batch
      to which each report for this aggregation job belongs
      (Section 5.2).

      Documents that define batch modes MUST specify the content this
      field; see Section 10 for details.

      The indicated batch mode MUST match the task's batch mode.
      Otherwise, the Helper MUST abort with error invalidMessage.

      This field is called the "partial" batch selector because,
      depending on the batch mode, it may not determine a batch.  In
      particular, if the batch mode is time_interval, the batch is not
      determined until the Collector's query is issued (see
      Section 4.2).

   *  prepare_inits: the sequence of PrepareInit messages constructed in
      the previous step.

   Finally, the Leader sends an HTTP PUT request to
   {helper}/tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id} with a
   media type of "application/dap-aggregation-job-init-req" and a body
   containing the AggregationJobInitReq.

   The Leader MUST authenticate its requests to the Helper using a
   scheme that meets the requirements in Section 3.1.

   The Helper responds with HTTP status 201 Created with a body
   containing an AggregationJobResp (see Section 4.8.1.2).  If the
   status field is ready, the Leader proceeds onward.  Otherwise, if the
   status field is processing, the Leader polls the aggregation job by
   sending GET requests to the URI indicated in the Location header
   field, until the status is ready.  The Helper's response when
   processing SHOULD include a Retry-After header to suggest a polling
   interval to the Leader.

   The AggregationJobResp.prepare_resps field must include exactly the
   same report IDs in the same order as the Leader's
   AggregationJobInitReq.  Otherwise, the Leader MUST abort the
   aggregation job.

   Otherwise, the Leader proceeds as follows with each report:

   1.  If the inbound prep response has type "continue", then the Leader
       computes

      (state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_continued(
          "dap-13" || task_id,
          agg_param,
          prev_state,
          inbound,
      )

       where:

       *  task_id is the task ID

       *  agg_param is the VDAF aggregation parameter provided by the
          Collector (see Section 4.9)

       *  prev_state is the state computed earlier by calling
          Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_init or Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_continued

       *  inbound is the message payload in the PrepareResp

       If outbound != None, then the Leader stores state and outbound
       and proceeds to Section 4.8.2.1.  If outbound == None, then the
       preparation process is complete: either state == Rejected(), in
       which case the Leader rejects the report and removes it from the
       candidate set; or state == Finished(out_share), in which case
       preparation is complete and the Leader updates the relevant batch
       bucket with out_share as described in Section 4.8.2.3.

   2.  Else if the type is "reject", then the Leader rejects the report
       and removes it from the candidate set.  The Leader MUST NOT
       include the report in a subsequent aggregation job, unless the
       error is report_too_early, in which case the Leader MAY include
       the report in a subsequent aggregation job.

   3.  Else the type is invalid, in which case the Leader MUST abort the
       aggregation job.

   When the Leader updates a batch bucket based on out_share, it MUST
   also store the report ID for replay protection.

   (Note: Since VDAF preparation completes in a constant number of
   rounds, it will never be the case that some reports are completed and
   others are not.)

   If the Leader fails to process the response from the Helper, for
   example because of a transient failure such as a network connection
   failure or process crash, the Leader SHOULD re-send the original
   request unmodified in order to attempt recovery (see
   Section 4.8.2.4).

4.8.1.2.  Helper Initialization

   The Helper begins an aggregation job when it receives an
   AggregationJobInitReq message from the Leader.  For each PrepareInit
   conveyed by this message, the Helper attempts to initialize VDAF
   preparation (see Section 5.1 of [VDAF]) just as the Leader does.  If
   successful, it includes the result in its response that the Leader
   will use to continue preparing the report.

   Upon receipt of an AggregationJobInitReq, the Helper checks if it
   recognizes the task ID.  If not, then it MUST abort with error
   unrecognizedTask.

   Next, the Helper checks that the aggregation parameter is valid as
   described in Section 4.6.  If the aggregation parameter is invalid,
   then the Helper MUST abort with error invalidAggregationParameter.

   Next, the Helper checks that the report IDs in
   AggregationJobInitReq.prepare_inits are all distinct.  If two
   preparation initialization messages have the same report ID, then the
   Helper MUST abort with error invalidMessage.

   To process the aggregation job, the Helper computes an outbound
   prepare step for each report share.  This includes the following
   structures:

   enum {
     continue(0),
     finished(1)
     reject(2),
     (255)
   } PrepareRespState;

   enum {
     reserved(0),
     batch_collected(1),
     report_replayed(2),
     report_dropped(3),
     hpke_unknown_config_id(4),
     hpke_decrypt_error(5),
     vdaf_prep_error(6),
     task_expired(7),
     invalid_message(8),
     report_too_early(9),
     task_not_started(10),
     (255)
   } ReportError;

   struct {
     ReportID report_id;
     PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state;
     select (PrepareResp.prepare_resp_state) {
       case continue: opaque payload<0..2^32-1>;
       case finished: Empty;
       case reject:   ReportError report_error;
     };
   } PrepareResp;

   First, for each report in the request, the Helper MAY check if the
   report ID corresponds to a report ID it has previously stored for
   this task.  If so, it rejects the report by setting the outbound
   preparation response to

   variant {
     ReportID report_id;
     PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = reject;
     ReportError report_error = report_replayed;
   } PrepareResp;

   where report_id is the report ID.  Note that the Helper must perform
   this check before completing the aggregation job.

   Next the Helper decrypts each of its remaining report shares as
   described in Section 4.8.1.3, then checks input share validity as
   described in Section 4.8.1.4.  For any report that was rejected, the
   Helper sets the outbound preparation response to

   variant {
     ReportID report_id;
     PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = reject;
     ReportError report_error;
   } PrepareResp;

   where report_id is the report ID and report_error is the indicated
   error.  For all other reports it initializes the VDAF prep state as
   follows (let inbound denote the payload of the prep step sent by the
   Leader):

   (state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_helper_init(
       vdaf_verify_key,
       "dap-13" || task_id,
       agg_param,
       report_id,
       public_share,
       plaintext_input_share.payload)

   where:

   *  vdaf_verify_key is the VDAF verification key for the task

   *  task_id is the task ID

   *  agg_param is the VDAF aggregation parameter sent in the
      AggregationJobInitReq

   *  report_id is the report ID

   *  public_share is the report's public share

   *  plaintext_input_share is the Helper's PlaintextInputShare

   This procedure determines the initial per-report state, as well as
   the initial outbound message to send in response to the Leader.  If
   state is of type Rejected, then the Helper responds with

   variant {
     ReportID report_id;
     PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = reject;
     ReportError report_error = vdaf_prep_error;
   } PrepareResp;

   Otherwise the Helper responds with

   variant {
     ReportID report_id;
     PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = continue;
     opaque payload<0..2^32-1> = outbound;
   } PrepareResp;

   If state == Continued(prep_state), then the Helper stores state to
   prepare for the next continuation step (Section 4.8.2.2).

   If state == Finished(out_share), the Helper MUST resolve replay of
   the report.  It does so by checking if the report ID was previously
   stored for this task.  If so, it responds with

   variant {
     ReportID report_id;
     PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = reject;
     Reporterror report_error = report_replayed;
   } PrepareResp;

   Otherwise it stores the report ID for replay protection and updates
   the relevant batch bucket with out_share as described in
   Section 4.8.2.3.

   Finally, the Helper creates an AggregationJobResp to send to the
   Leader.  This message is structured as follows:

   enum {
     processing(0),
     ready(1),
     (255)
   } AggregationJobStatus;

   struct {
     AggregationJobStatus status;
     select (AggregationJobResp.status) {
       case processing: Empty;
       case ready:      PrepareResp prepare_resps<0..2^32-1>;
     };
   } AggregationJobResp;

   where prepare_resps are the outbound prep steps computed in the
   previous step.  The order MUST match
   AggregationJobInitReq.prepare_inits.

   The Helper responds to the Leader with HTTP status 201 Created, a
   body consisting of the AggregationJobResp, and the media type
   "application/dap-aggregation-job-resp".

   Depending on the task parameters, processing an aggregation job may
   take some time, so the Helper MAY defer computation to a background
   process.  It does so by responding with the field status set to
   processing and a Location header field set to the relative reference
   /tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}?step=0.  The
   Leader then polls the Helper by making HTTP GET requests to the
   aforementioned Location.  The Helper responds to GET requests with
   HTTP status 200 and the status field reflecting the current state of
   the job.  When the aggregation job is processing, the response SHOULD
   include a Retry-After header field to suggest a polling interval to
   the Leader.

   Changing an aggregation job's parameters is illegal, so further HTTP
   PUT requests to /tasks/{task-id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-
   id} for the same aggregation-job-id but with a different
   AggregationJobInitReq in the body MUST fail with an HTTP client error
   status code.  For further requests with the same
   AggregationJobInitReq in the body, the Helper SHOULD respond as it
   did for the original AggregationJobInitReq, or otherwise fail with an
   HTTP client error status code.

   Additionally, it is not possible to rewind or reset the state of an
   aggregation job.  Once an aggregation job has been continued at least
   once (see Section 4.8.2), further requests to initialize that
   aggregation job MUST fail with an HTTP client error status code.

4.8.1.3.  Input Share Decryption

   Each report share has a corresponding task ID, report metadata
   (report ID, timestamp, and public extensions), public share, and the
   Aggregator's encrypted input share.  Let task_id, report_metadata,
   public_share, and encrypted_input_share denote these values,
   respectively.  Given these values, an Aggregator decrypts the input
   share as follows.  First, it constructs an InputShareAad message from
   task_id, report_metadata, and public_share.  Let this be denoted by
   input_share_aad.  Then, the Aggregator looks up the HPKE config and
   corresponding secret key indicated by encrypted_input_share.config_id
   and attempts decryption of the payload with the following procedure:

   plaintext_input_share = OpenBase(encrypted_input_share.enc, sk,
     "dap-13 input share" || 0x01 || server_role,
     input_share_aad, encrypted_input_share.payload)

   where sk is the HPKE secret key, 0x01 represents the Role of the
   sender (always the Client), and server_role is the Role of the
   recipient Aggregator (0x02 for the Leader and 0x03 for the Helper).
   The OpenBase() function is as specified in [HPKE], Section 6.1 for
   the ciphersuite indicated by the HPKE configuration.  If decryption
   fails, the Aggregator marks the report share as invalid with the
   error hpke_decrypt_error.  Otherwise, the Aggregator outputs the
   resulting PlaintextInputShare plaintext_input_share.

4.8.1.4.  Input Share Validation

   Validating an input share will either succeed or fail.  In the case
   of failure, the input share is marked as invalid with a corresponding
   report error.

   Before beginning the preparation step, Aggregators are required to
   perform the following checks:

   1.  Check that the input share can be decoded as specified by the
       VDAF.  If not, the input share MUST be marked as invalid with the
       error invalid_message.

   2.  Check that the report's timestamp is well-formed as specified in
       Section 4.5.  If not, the Aggregator MUST mark the input share as
       invalid with error invalid_message.

   3.  Check if the report's timestamp is too far in the future.  If the
       report's timestamp is more than a few minutes ahead of the
       current time, then the Aggregator SHOULD mark the input share as
       invalid with error report_too_early.

   4.  Check if the report's timestamp is before the task's task_start
       time.  If so, the Aggregator MUST mark the input share as invalid
       with the error task_not_started.

   5.  Check if the report's timestamp is past the task's end time,
       given by task_start + task_duration.  If so, the Aggregator MUST
       mark the input share as invalid with the error task_expired.

   6.  Check if the public or private report extensions contain any
       unrecognized report extension types.  If so, the Aggregator MUST
       mark the input share as invalid with error invalid_message.

   7.  Check if any two public or private report extensions have the
       same extension type.  (For the purposes of this check, a private
       report extension can conflict with a public report extension.)
       If so, the Aggregator MUST mark the input share as invalid with
       error invalid_message.

   8.  If the report pertains to a batch that was previously collected,
       then the input share MUST be marked as invalid with error
       batch_collected.

       *  Implementation note: The Leader considers a batch to be
          collected once it has completed a collection job for a
          CollectionJobReq message from the Collector; the Helper
          considers a batch to be collected once it has responded to an
          AggregateShareReq message from the Leader.  A batch is
          determined by query (Section 4.2) conveyed in these messages.
          Queries must satisfy the criteria covered in Section 4.9.5.
          These criteria are meant to restrict queries in a way that
          makes it easy to determine whether a report pertains to a
          batch that was collected.  See Section 6.4.2 for more
          information.

   9.  Finally, if an Aggregator cannot determine if an input share is
       valid, it MUST mark the input share as invalid with error
       report_dropped.  For example, the report timestamp may be so far
       in the past that the state required to perform the check has been
       evicted from the Aggregator's long-term storage.  See
       Section 6.4.1 for details.

   If all of the above checks succeed, the input share is not marked as
   invalid.

4.8.2.  Aggregate Continuation

   In the continuation phase, the Leader drives the VDAF preparation of
   each report in the candidate report set until the underlying VDAF
   moves into a terminal state, yielding an output share for both
   Aggregators or a rejection.

   Whether this phase is reached depends on the VDAF: for 1-round VDAFs,
   like Prio3, processing has already completed.  Continuation is
   required for VDAFs that require more than one round.

4.8.2.1.  Leader Continuation

   The Leader begins each step of aggregation continuation with a prep
   state object state and an outbound message outbound for each report
   in the candidate set.

   The Leader advances its aggregation job to the next step (step 1 if
   this is the first continuation after initialization).  Then it
   instructs the Helper to advance the aggregation job to the step the
   Leader has just reached.  For each report the Leader constructs a
   preparation continuation message:

   struct {
     ReportID report_id;
     opaque payload<0..2^32-1>;
   } PrepareContinue;

   where report_id is the report ID associated with state and outbound,
   and payload is set to the outbound message.

   Next, the Leader sends a POST request to {helper}/tasks/{task-
   id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id} with media type
   "application/dap-aggregation-job-continue-req" and body structured
   as:

   struct {
     uint16 step;
     PrepareContinue prepare_continues<0..2^32-1>;
   } AggregationJobContinueReq;

   The step field is the step of DAP aggregation that the Leader just
   reached and wants the Helper to advance to.  The prepare_continues
   field is the sequence of preparation continuation messages
   constructed in the previous step.  The PrepareContinues MUST be in
   the same order as the previous aggregate request.

   The Leader MUST authenticate its requests to the Helper using a
   scheme that meets the requirements in Section 3.1.

   The Helper responds with HTTP status 202 Accepted with a body
   containing an AggregationJobResp (see Section 4.8.1.2).  If the
   status field is ready, the Leader proceeds onward.  Otherwise, if the
   status field is processing, the Leader polls the aggregation job by
   sending GET requests to the URI indicated in the Location header
   field, until the status is ready.  The Helper's response when
   processing SHOULD include a Retry-After header to suggest a polling
   interval to the Leader.

   The response's prepare_resps MUST include exactly the same report IDs
   in the same order as the Leader's AggregationJobContinueReq.
   Otherwise, the Leader MUST abort the aggregation job.

   Otherwise, the Leader proceeds as follows with each report:

   1.  If the inbound prep response type is "continue" and the state is
       Continued(prep_state), then the Leader computes

      (state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_continued(
          "dap-13" || task_id,
          agg_param,
          state,
          inbound,
      )

       where task_id is the task ID and inbound is the message payload.
       If outbound != None, then the Leader stores state and outbound
       and proceeds to another continuation step.  If outbound == None,
       then the preparation process is complete: either state ==
       Rejected(), in which case the Leader rejects the report and
       removes it from the candidate set; or state ==
       Finished(out_share), in which case preparation is complete and
       the Leader updates the relevant batch bucket with out_share as
       described in Section 4.8.2.3.

   2.  Else if the type is "finished" and state == Finished(out_share),
       then preparation is complete and the Leader stores the output
       share for use in the collection interaction (Section 4.9).

   3.  Else if the type is "reject", then the Leader rejects the report
       and removes it from the candidate set.

   4.  Else the type is invalid, in which case the Leader MUST abort the
       aggregation job.

   When the Leader stores the out_share, it MUST also store the report
   ID for replay protection.

   If the Leader fails to process the response from the Helper, for
   example because of a transient failure such as a network connection
   failure or process crash, the Leader SHOULD re-send the original
   request unmodified in order to attempt recovery (see
   Section 4.8.2.4).

4.8.2.2.  Helper Continuation

   The Helper begins each step of continuation with a sequence of state
   objects, which will be Continued(prep_state), one for each report in
   the candidate set.

   The Helper awaits an HTTP POST request to {helper}/tasks/{task-
   id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id} from the Leader, the body
   of which is an AggregationJobContinueReq as specified in
   Section 4.8.2.1.

   Next, it checks that it recognizes the task ID.  If not, then it MUST
   abort with error unrecognizedTask.

   Next, it checks if it recognizes the indicated aggregation job ID.
   If not, it MUST abort with error unrecognizedAggregationJob.

   Next, the Helper checks that:

   1.  the report IDs are all distinct

   2.  each report ID corresponds to one of the state objects

   3.  AggregationJobContinueReq.step is not equal to 0

   If any of these checks fail, then the Helper MUST abort with error
   invalidMessage.  Additionally, if any prep step appears out of order
   relative to the previous request, then the Helper MAY abort with
   error invalidMessage.  (Note that a report may be missing, in which
   case the Helper should assume the Leader rejected it.)

   Next, the Helper checks if the continuation step indicated by the
   request is correct.  (For the first AggregationJobContinueReq the
   value should be 1; for the second the value should be 2; and so on.)
   If the Leader is one step behind (e.g., the Leader has resent the
   previous HTTP request), then the Helper MAY attempt to recover by
   sending the same response as it did for the previous
   AggregationJobContinueReq, without performing any additional work on
   the aggregation job.  In this case it SHOULD verify that the contents
   of the AggregationJobContinueReq are identical to the previous
   message (see Section 4.8.2.4).  Otherwise, if the step is incorrect
   or if the Helper does not wish to attempt recovery, the Helper MUST
   abort with error stepMismatch.

   Let inbound denote the payload of the prep step.  For each report,
   the Helper computes the following:

   (state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_helper_continued(
       "dap-13" || task_id,
       agg_param,
       state,
       inbound,
   )

   where task_id is the task ID.  If state == Rejected(), then the
   Helper's response is

   variant {
     ReportID report_id;
     PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = reject;
     ReportError report_error = vdaf_prep_error;
   } PrepareResp;

   If state == Continued(prep_state), then the Helper stores state to
   prepare for the next continuation step (Section 4.8.2.2).

   If state == Finished(out_share), the Helper MUST resolve replay of
   the report.  It does so by checking if the report ID was previously
   stored for this task.  If so, it responds with

   variant {
     ReportID report_id;
     PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = reject;
     ReportError report_error = report_replayed;
   } PrepareResp;

   Otherwise it stores the report ID for replay protection and updates
   the relevant batch bucket with out_share as described in
   Section 4.8.2.3.

   The Helper's response depends on the value of outbound.  If outbound
   != None, then the Helper's response is

   variant {
     ReportID report_id;
     PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = continue;
     opaque payload<0..2^32-1> = outbound;
   } PrepareResp;

   Otherwise, if outbound == None, then the Helper's response is

   variant {
     ReportID report_id;
     PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = finished;
   } PrepareResp;

   The Helper constructs an AggregationJobResp message (see
   Section 4.8.1.2) with each prep step.  The order of the prep steps
   MUST match the Leader's AggregationJobContinueReq.

   The Helper responds to the Leader with HTTP status 202 Accepted, a
   body consisting of the AggregationJobResp, and the media type
   "application/dap-aggregation-job-resp".

   Depending on the task parameters, processing an aggregation job may
   take some time, so the Helper MAY defer computation to a background
   process by responding with the field status set to processing and
   Location header field set to the relative reference /tasks/{task-
   id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}?step={step}, where step is
   the step indicated in the AggregationJobContinueReq.  If so, the
   Leader polls the Helper by making HTTP GET requests to the
   aforementioned Location.  The Helper responds to GET requests with
   HTTP status 200 and the status field reflecting the current state of
   the job.  When the aggregation job is processing, the response SHOULD
   include a Retry-After header field to suggest a polling interval to
   the Leader.

   If for whatever reason the Leader must abandon the aggregation job,
   it SHOULD send an HTTP DELETE request to {helper}/tasks/{task-
   id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id} so that the Helper knows it
   can clean up its state.

4.8.2.3.  Batch Buckets

   When aggregation recovers an output share, it must be stored into an
   appropriate "batch bucket", which is defined in this section.  The
   data stored in a batch bucket is kept for eventual use in the
   Section 4.9.

   Batch buckets are indexed by a "batch bucket identifier" as as
   specified by the task's batch mode:

   *  For the time-interval batch mode (Section 5.1, the batch bucket
      identifier is an interval of time and is determined by the
      report's timestamp.

   *  For the leader-selected batch mode (Section 5.2), the batch bucket
      identifier is the batch ID and indicated in the aggregation job.

   A few different pieces of information are associated with each batch
   bucket:

   *  A VDAF-specific aggregate share, as defined in [VDAF].

   *  A count of a number of reports included in the batch bucket.

   *  A 32-byte checksum value, as defined below.

   When processing an output share out_share, the following procedure is
   used to update the batch buckets:

   *  Look up the existing batch bucket for the batch bucket identifier
      associated with the aggregation job and output share.

      -  If there is no existing batch bucket, initialize a new one.
         The initial aggregate share value is computed as
         Vdaf.agg_init(agg_param), where agg_param is the aggregation
         parameter associated with the aggregation job (see [VDAF],
         Section 4.4); the initial count is 0; and the initial checksum
         is 32 zero bytes.

   *  Update the aggregate share agg_share to Vdaf.agg_update(agg_param,
      agg_share, out_share).

   *  Increment the count by 1.

   *  Update the checksum value to the bitwise-XOR of the checksum value
      with the SHA256 [SHS] hash of the report ID associated with the
      output share.

   Implementation note: this section describes a single set of values
   associated with each batch bucket.  However, implementations are free
   to shard the aggregate share/count/checksum values associated with
   the batch bucket, combining them back into a single set of values
   when reading the batch bucket.  This may be useful to avoid write
   contention.  The aggregate share values are combined using
   Vdaf.merge(agg_param, agg_shares) (see [VDAF], Section 4.4), the
   count values are combined by summing, and the checksum values are
   combined by bitwise XOR.

4.8.2.4.  Recovering from Aggregation Step Skew

   AggregationJobContinueReq messages contain a step field, allowing
   Aggregators to ensure that their peer is on an expected step of DAP
   aggregation.  In particular, the intent is to allow recovery from a
   scenario where the Helper successfully advances from step n to n+1,
   but its AggregationJobResp response to the Leader gets dropped due to
   something like a transient network failure.  The Leader could then
   resend the request to have the Helper advance to step n+1 and the
   Helper should be able to retransmit the AggregationJobResp that was
   previously dropped.  To make that kind of recovery possible,
   Aggregator implementations SHOULD checkpoint the most recent step's
   prep state and messages to durable storage such that the Leader can
   re-construct continuation requests and the Helper can re-construct
   continuation responses as needed.

   When implementing an aggregation step skew recovery strategy, the
   Helper SHOULD ensure that the Leader's AggregationJobContinueReq
   message did not change when it was re-sent (i.e., the two messages
   must be identical).  This prevents the Leader from re-winding an
   aggregation job and re-running an aggregation step with different
   parameters.

   One way the Helper could address this would be to store a digest of
   the Leader's request, indexed by aggregation job ID and step, and
   refuse to service a request for a given aggregation step unless it
   matches the previously seen request (if any).

4.9.  Collecting Results

   In this phase, the Collector requests aggregate shares from each
   Aggregator and then locally combines them to yield a single aggregate
   result.  In particular, the Collector issues a query to the Leader
   (Section 4.2), which the Aggregators use to select a batch of reports
   to aggregate.  Each Aggregator emits an aggregate share encrypted to
   the Collector so that it can decrypt and combine them to yield the
   aggregate result.  This entire process is composed of two
   interactions:

   1.  Collect request and response between the Collector and Leader,
       specified in Section 4.9.1

   2.  Aggregate share request and response between the Leader and the
       Helper, specified in Section 4.9.2

   Once complete, the Collector computes the final aggregate result as
   specified in Section 4.9.3.

   This overall process is referred to as a "collection job".

4.9.1.  Collection Job Initialization

   First, the Collector chooses a collection job ID:

   opaque CollectionJobID[16];

   This ID value MUST be unique within the scope of the corresponding
   DAP task.

   To initiate the collection job, the collector issues a PUT request to
   {leader}/tasks/{task-id}/collection_jobs/{collection-job-id}. The
   body of the request has media type "application/dap-collection-job-
   req", and it is structured as follows:

   struct {
     BatchMode batch_mode;
     opaque config<0..2^16-1>;
   } Query;

   struct {
     Query query;
     opaque agg_param<0..2^32-1>; /* VDAF aggregation parameter */
   } CollectionJobReq;

   The named parameters are:

   *  query, the Collector's query.  The content of this field depends
      on the indicated batch mode: for time-interval mode, the config
      field contains the requested time interval (Section 5.1); for
      leader-selected mode, the config field is empty, and the Collector
      gets the aggregate result for the next batch selected by the
      Leader (Section 5.2).

      Batch modes defined by future documents MUST specify the content
      of this field; see Section 10 for details.

      The indicated batch mode MUST match the task's batch mode.
      Otherwise, the Leader MUST abort with error "invalidMessage".

   *  agg_param, an aggregation parameter for the VDAF being executed.
      This is the same value as in AggregationJobInitReq (see
      Section 4.8.1.1).  The aggregation parameter MUST be valid as
      defined in Section 4.6.

   Collectors MUST authenticate their requests to Leaders using a scheme
   that meets the requirements in Section 3.1.

   Depending on the VDAF scheme and how the Leader is configured, the
   Leader and Helper may already have prepared a sufficient number of
   reports satisfying the query and be ready to return the aggregate
   shares right away.  However, this is not always the case.  In fact,
   for some VDAFs, it is not be possible to begin running aggregation
   jobs (Section 4.8) until the Collector initiates a collection job.
   This is because, in general, the aggregation parameter is not known
   until this point.  In certain situations it is possible to predict
   the aggregation parameter in advance.  For example, for Prio3 the
   only valid aggregation parameter is the empty string.  For these
   reasons, the collection job is handled asynchronously.  If
   aggregation is performed eagerly, the Leader MUST validate that the
   aggregation parameter received in the CollectionJobReq matches the
   aggregation parameter used in aggregations.

   Upon receipt of a CollectionJobReq, the Leader begins by checking
   that it recognizes the task ID in the request path.  If not, it MUST
   abort with error unrecognizedTask.

   Next, the Leader checks that the aggregation parameter is valid as
   described in Section 4.6.  If the aggregation parameter is invalid,
   then the Leader MUST abort with error invalidAggregationParameter.

   The Leader MAY further validate the request according to the
   requirements in Section 4.9.5 and abort with the indicated error,
   though some conditions such as the number of valid reports may not be
   verifiable while handling the CollectionJobReq message, and the batch
   will have to be re-validated later on regardless.

   Changing a collection job's parameters is illegal, so further
   requests to PUT /tasks/{task-id}/collection_jobs/{collection-job-id}
   for the same collection-job-id but with a different CollectionJobReq
   in the body MUST fail with an HTTP client error status code.

   The Leader responds to CollectionJobReqs with a CollectionJobResp,
   which is structured as follows:

   enum {
     processing(0),
     ready(1),
     (255)
   } CollectionJobStatus;

   struct {
     PartialBatchSelector part_batch_selector;
     uint64 report_count;
     Interval interval;
     HpkeCiphertext leader_encrypted_agg_share;
     HpkeCiphertext helper_encrypted_agg_share;
   } Collection;

   struct {
     CollectionJobStatus status;
     select (CollectionJob.status) {
       case processing: Empty;
       case ready:      Collection;
     }
   } CollectionJobResp;

   The body's media type is "application/dap-collection-job-resp".  The
   Collection structure includes the following:

   *  part_batch_selector: Information used to bind the aggregate result
      to the query.  For leader-selected tasks, this includes the batch
      ID assigned to the batch by the Leader.  The indicated batch mode
      MUST match the task's batch mode.

   *  report_count: The number of reports included in the batch.

   *  interval: The smallest interval of time that contains the
      timestamps of all reports included in the batch.  Note that in the
      case of a time-interval query (Section 5.1), this interval can be
      smaller than the one in the corresponding CollectionJobReq.query.

   *  leader_encrypted_agg_share: The Leader's aggregate share,
      encrypted to the Collector (see Section 4.9.4).

   *  helper_encrypted_agg_share: The Helper's aggregate share,
      encrypted to the Collector (see Section 4.9.4).

   If the Leader finds the CollectionJobReq to be valid, it immediately
   responds with HTTP status 201 Created with a body containing a
   CollectionJobResp with the status field set to processing.  The
   Leader SHOULD include a Retry-After header field to suggest a polling
   interval to the Collector.

   After receiving the response to its CollectionJobReq, the Collector
   periodically makes HTTP GET requests /tasks/{task-
   id}/collection_jobs/{collection-job-id} to check on the status of the
   collection job and eventually obtain the result.  The Leader responds
   to GET requests with HTTP status 200 and the status field reflecting
   the current state of the job.  When the collection job is processing,
   the response SHOULD include a Retry-After header field to suggest a
   polling interval to the Collector.

   The Leader then begins working with the Helper to aggregate the
   reports satisfying the query (or continues this process, depending on
   the VDAF) as described in Section 4.8.

   The Leader first checks whether it can construct a batch for the
   collection job by applying the requirements in Section 4.9.5.  If so,
   then the Leader obtains the Helper's aggregate share following the
   aggregate-share request flow described in Section 4.9.2.  If not, it
   either aborts the collection job or tries again later, depending on
   which requirement in Section 4.9.5 was not met.  If the Leader has a
   pending aggregation job that overlaps with the batch and aggregation
   parameter for the collection job, the Leader MUST first complete the
   aggregation job before proceeding and requesting an aggregate share
   from the Helper.  This avoids a race condition between aggregation
   and collection jobs that can yield trivial batch mismatch errors.

   Once both aggregate shares are successfully obtained, the Leader
   responds to subsequent HTTP GET requests with the status field set to
   ready and the Collection field populated with the encrypted aggregate
   shares.  The Collector stops polling once receiving this final
   request.

   If obtaining aggregate shares fails, then the Leader responds to
   subsequent HTTP GET requests to the collection job with an HTTP error
   status and a problem document as described in Section 3.2.

   The Leader MAY respond with HTTP status 204 No Content to requests to
   a collection job if the results have been deleted.

   The Collector can send an HTTP DELETE request to the collection job,
   which indicates to the Leader that it can abandon the collection job
   and discard all state related to it.

4.9.2.  Obtaining Aggregate Shares

   The Leader must compute its own aggregate share, as well as obtaining
   the Helper's encrypted aggregate share, before it can complete a
   collection job.

   First, the Leader retrieves all batch buckets (Section 4.8.2.3)
   associated with this collection job.  The batch buckets to retrieve
   depend on the batch mode of this task:

   *  For time-interval (Section 5.1), this is all batch buckets whose
      batch bucket identifiers are contained within the batch interval
      specified in the CollectionJobReq's query.

   *  For leader-selected (Section 5.2), this is the batch bucket
      associated with the batch ID the Leader has chosen for this
      collection job.

   The Leader then combines the values inside the batch bucket as
   follows:

   *  Aggregate shares are combined via Vdaf.merge(agg_param,
      agg_shares) ((see [VDAF], Section 4.4)), where agg_param is the
      aggregation parameter provided in the CollectionJobReq, and
      agg_shares are the (partial) aggregate shares in the batch
      buckets.  The result is the final aggregate share for this
      collection job.

   *  Report counts are combined via summing.

   *  Checksums are combined via bitwise XOR.

   Then the Leader sends a POST request to {helper}/tasks/{task-
   id}/aggregate_shares with the following message:

   struct {
     BatchMode batch_mode;
     opaque config<0..2^16-1>;
   } BatchSelector;

   struct {
     BatchSelector batch_selector;
     opaque agg_param<0..2^32-1>;
     uint64 report_count;
     opaque checksum[32];
   } AggregateShareReq;

   The media type of the request is "application/dap-aggregate-share-
   req".  The message contains the following parameters:

   *  batch_selector: The "batch selector", the contents of which
      depends on the indicated batch mode: for time-interval mode, the
      config field contains the time interval selected by the Collector
      (Section 5.1); in leader-selected mode, the field contains the
      batch ID selected by the Leader (Section 5.2).

      Future documents that new batch modes MUST specify the contents of
      the config field; see Section 10 for details.

      The indicated batch mode MUST match the task's batch mode.
      Otherwise, the Helper MUST abort with "invalidMessage".

   *  agg_param: The opaque aggregation parameter for the VDAF being
      executed.  This value MUST match the AggregationJobInitReq message
      for each aggregation job used to compute the aggregate shares (see
      Section 4.8.1.1) and the aggregation parameter indicated by the
      Collector in the CollectionJobReq message (see Section 4.9.1).

   *  report_count: The number number of reports included in the batch,
      as computed above.

   *  checksum: The batch checksum, as computed above.

   Leaders MUST authenticate their requests to Helpers using a scheme
   that meets the requirements in Section 3.1.

   To handle the Leader's request, the Helper first ensures that it
   recognizes the task ID in the request path.  If not, it MUST abort
   with error unrecognizedTask.  The Helper then verifies that the
   request meets the requirements for batch parameters following the
   procedure in Section 4.9.5.  The Helper MUST validate that the
   aggregation parameter matches the aggregation parameter used during
   aggregation of this batch; otherwise, it aborts with
   "invalidMessage".

   Next, the Helper retrieves and combines the batch buckets associated
   with the request using the same process used by the Leader (as
   described at the beginning of this section Section 4.9.2), arriving
   at its final aggregate share, report count, and checksum values.  If
   the Helper's computed report count and checksum values do not match
   the values provided in the AggregateShareReq, it MUST abort with an
   error of type "batchMismatch".

   The Helper then encrypts agg_share under the Collector's HPKE public
   key as described in Section 4.9.4, yielding encrypted_agg_share.
   Encryption prevents the Leader from learning the actual result, as it
   only has its own aggregate share and cannot compute the Helper's.

   The Helper responds to the Leader with HTTP status code 200 OK and a
   body consisting of an AggregateShare, with media type "application/
   dap-aggregate-share":

   struct {
     HpkeCiphertext encrypted_aggregate_share;
   } AggregateShare;

   encrypted_aggregate_share.config_id is set to the Collector's HPKE
   config ID. encrypted_aggregate_share.enc is set to the encapsulated
   HPKE context enc computed above and
   encrypted_aggregate_share.ciphertext is the ciphertext
   encrypted_agg_share computed above.

   The Helper's handling of this request MUST be idempotent.  That is,
   if multiple identical, valid AggregateShareReqs are received, they
   should all yield the same response.

   After receiving the Helper's response, the Leader uses the
   HpkeCiphertext to finalize a collection job (see Section 4.9.3).

   Once an AggregateShareReq has been issued for the batch determined by
   a given query, it is an error for the Leader to issue any more
   aggregation jobs for additional reports that satisfy the query.
   These reports will be rejected by the Helper as described in
   Section 4.8.1.4.

   Before completing the collection job, the Leader encrypts its
   aggregate share under the Collector's HPKE public key as described in
   Section 4.9.4.

4.9.3.  Collection Job Finalization

   Once the Collector has received a collection job from the Leader, it
   can decrypt the aggregate shares and produce an aggregate result.
   The Collector decrypts each aggregate share as described in
   Section 4.9.4.  Once the Collector successfully decrypts all
   aggregate shares, it unshards the aggregate shares into an aggregate
   result using the VDAF's unshard algorithm.  In particular, let
   leader_agg_share denote the Leader's aggregate share,
   helper_agg_share denote the Helper's aggregate share, let
   report_count denote the report count sent by the Leader, and let
   agg_param be the opaque aggregation parameter.  The final aggregate
   result is computed as follows:

   agg_result = Vdaf.unshard(agg_param,
                             [leader_agg_share, helper_agg_share],
                             report_count)

4.9.4.  Aggregate Share Encryption

   Encrypting an aggregate share agg_share for a given AggregateShareReq
   is done as follows:

   (enc, payload) = SealBase(
       pk,
       "dap-13 aggregate share" || server_role || 0x00,
       agg_share_aad,
       agg_share)

   where pk is the HPKE public key encoded by the Collector's HPKE key,
   server_role is the Role of the encrypting server (0x02 for the Leader
   and 0x03 for a Helper), 0x00 represents the Role of the recipient
   (always the Collector), and agg_share_aad is a value of type
   AggregateShareAad.  The SealBase() function is as specified in
   [HPKE], Section 6.1 for the ciphersuite indicated by the HPKE
   configuration.

   struct {
     TaskID task_id;
     opaque agg_param<0..2^32-1>;
     BatchSelector batch_selector;
   } AggregateShareAad;

   *  task_id is the ID of the task the aggregate share was computed in.

   *  agg_param is the aggregation parameter used to compute the
      aggregate share.

   *  batch_selector is the is the batch selector from the
      AggregateShareReq (for the Helper) or the batch selector computed
      from the Collector's query (for the Leader).

   The Collector decrypts these aggregate shares using the opposite
   process.  Specifically, given an encrypted input share, denoted
   enc_share, for a given batch selector, decryption works as follows:

   agg_share = OpenBase(
       enc_share.enc,
       sk,
       "dap-13 aggregate share" || server_role || 0x00,
       agg_share_aad,
       enc_share.payload)

   where sk is the HPKE secret key, server_role is the Role of the
   server that sent the aggregate share (0x02 for the Leader and 0x03
   for the Helper), 0x00 represents the Role of the recipient (always
   the Collector), and agg_share_aad is an AggregateShareAad message
   constructed from the task ID and the aggregation parameter in the
   collect request, and a batch selector.  The value of the batch
   selector used in agg_share_aad is determined by the batch mode.

   *  For time-interval (Section 5.1), the batch selector is the batch
      interval specified in the query.

   *  For leader-selected (Section 5.2), the batch selector is the batch
      ID sent in the response.

   The OpenBase() function is as specified in [HPKE], Section 6.1 for
   the ciphersuite indicated by the HPKE configuration.

4.9.5.  Batch Validation

   When the Leader receives a Query in the request from the Collector
   during collection initialization (Section 4.9.1), it must first check
   that the batch determined by the query can be collected.  It does so
   as described here.  The Helper performs the same check when it
   receives a BatchSelector in the request from the Leader for its
   aggregate share (Section 4.9.2).

   First, the Aggregator checks if the request (the CollectionJobReq for
   the Leader and the AggregateShareReq for the Helper) identifies a
   valid set of batch buckets (Section 4.8.2.3).  If not, it MUST abort
   the request with "batchInvalid".

   Next, the Aggregator checks that batch contains a valid number of
   reports.  The Aggregator checks that len(X) >= min_batch_size, where
   X is the set of reports successfully aggregated into the batch and
   min_batch_size is the minimum batch size for the task.  If this check
   fails, then Helpers MUST abort with an error of type
   "invalidBatchSize".  Leaders SHOULD wait for more reports to be
   validated and try the collection job again later.

   Next, the Aggregator checks if the set of batch buckets identified by
   the request overlaps with the batch buckets that have already been
   collected.  If so, it MUST abort with "batchOverlap".

   Finally, the batch mode may define additional batch validation rules.

5.  Batch Modes

   This section defines an initial set of batch modes for DAP.  New
   batch modes may be defined by future documents following the
   guidelines in Section 10.

   Each batch mode specifies the following:

   1.  The value of the config field of Query, PartialBatchSelector, and
       BatchSelector

   2.  Batch buckets (Section 4.8.2.3): how reports are assigned to
       batch buckets; how each bucket is identified; and how batch
       buckets are mapped to batches and how batch buckets

5.1.  Time Interval

   enum {
     time_interval(1),
     (255)
   } BatchMode;

   The time-interval batch mode is designed to support applications in
   which reports are collected into batches grouped by an interval of
   time.  The Collector specifies a "batch interval" that determines the
   time range for reports included in the batch.  For each report in the
   batch, the time at which that report was generated (see Section 4.7)
   MUST fall within the batch interval specified by the Collector.

   Typically the Collector issues queries for which the batch intervals
   are continuous, monotonically increasing, and have the same duration.
   For example, the sequence of batch intervals (1659544000, 1000),
   (1659545000, 1000), (1659546000, 1000), (1659547000, 1000) satisfies
   these conditions.  (The first element of the pair denotes the start
   of the batch interval and the second denotes the duration.)  However,
   this is not a requirement--the Collector may decide to issue queries
   out-of-order.  In addition, the Collector may need to vary the
   duration to adjust to changing report upload rates.

5.1.1.  Query Configuration

   The payload of Query.config is

   struct {
     Interval batch_interval;
   } TimeIntervalQueryConfig;

   where batch_interval is the batch interval requested by the
   Collector.  The interval MUST be well-formed as specified in
   Section 4.5.  Otherwise, the query does not specify a set of valid
   batch buckets.

5.1.2.  Partial Batch Selector Configuration

   The payload of PartialBatchSelector.config is empty.

5.1.3.  Batch Selector Configuration

   The payload of BatchSelector.config is

   struct {
     Interval batch_interval;
   } TimeIntervalBatchSelectorConfig;

   where batch_interval is the batch interval requested by the
   Collector.

5.1.4.  Batch Buckets

   Each batch bucket is identified by an interval of time whose
   beginning is a multiple of the task's time_precision and whose
   duration is equal to the task's time_precision.  The identifier
   associated with a given report is the unique such interval containing
   the timestamp of the report; for example, if the task's
   time_precision is 1000 seconds and the report's timestamp is
   1729629081, the relevant batch bucket identifier is (1729629000,
   1000).  The first element of the pair denotes the start of the batch
   interval and the second denotes the duration.

   The Query received by the Leader determines a valid set of batch
   bucket identifiers if the following conditions hold (likewise for the
   BatchSelector received by the Helper):

   *  batch_interval.duration >= time_precision (this field determines,
      effectively, the minimum batch duration)

   *  both batch_interval.start and batch_interval.duration are
      divisible by time_precision

   A batch consists of a sequence of contiguous batch buckets.  That is,
   the set of batch buckets identifiers for the batch interval is
   (batch_interval.start, batch_interval.start + time_precision),
   (batch_interval.start + time_precision, batch_interval.start +
   2*time_precision), ..., (batch_interval.start +
   batch_interval.duration - time_precision) + batch_interval.start +
   batch_interval.duration).

5.2.  Leader-selected Batch Mode

   enum {
     leader_selected(2),
     (255)
   } BatchMode;

   The leader-selected batch mode is used to support applications in
   which it is acceptable for reports to be batched in an arbitrary
   fashion by the Leader.  Each batch of reports is identified by an
   opaque "batch ID".  Both the reports included in each batch and the
   ID for each batch are allocated in an arbitrary fashion by the
   Leader.

   The Collector will not know the set of batch IDs available for
   collection.  To get the aggregate of a batch, the Collector issues a
   query, which does not include any information specifying a particular
   batch (see Section 4.2).  The Leader selects a recent batch to
   aggregate.  The Leader MUST select a batch that has not yet been
   associated with a collection job.

   The Aggregators can output batches of any size that is larger than or
   equal to min_batch_size.  The target batch size, if any, is
   implementation-specific, and may be equal to or greater than the
   minimum batch size.  Deciding how soon batches should be output is
   also implementation-specific.  Exactly sizing batches may be
   challenging for Leader deployments in which multiple, independent
   nodes running the aggregate interaction (see Section 4.8) need to be
   coordinated.

5.2.1.  Query Configuration

   They payload of Query.config is empty; the request merely indicates
   the Collector would like the next batch selected by the Leader.

5.2.2.  Partial Batch Selector Configuration

   The payload of PartialBatchSelector.config is:

   struct {
     BatchID batch_id;
   } LeaderSelectedPartialBatchSelectorConfig;

   where batch_id is the batch ID selected by the Leader.

5.2.3.  Batch Selector Configuration

   The payload of BatchSelector.config is:

   struct {
     BatchID batch_id;
   } LeaderSelectedBatchSelectorConfig;

   where batch_id is the batch ID selected by the Leader.

5.2.4.  Batch Buckets

   Each batch consists of a single bucket and is identified by the batch
   ID selected by the Leader.  A report is assigned to the batch
   indicated by the PartialBatchSelector during aggregation.

6.  Operational Considerations

   The DAP protocol has inherent constraints derived from the tradeoff
   between privacy guarantees and computational complexity.  These
   tradeoffs influence how applications may choose to utilize services
   implementing the specification.

6.1.  Protocol Participant Capabilities

   The design in this document has different assumptions and
   requirements for different protocol participants, including Clients,
   Aggregators, and Collectors.  This section describes these
   capabilities in more detail.

6.1.1.  Client Capabilities

   Clients have limited capabilities and requirements.  Their only
   inputs to the protocol are (1) the parameters configured out of band
   and (2) a measurement.  Clients are not expected to store any state
   across any upload flows, nor are they required to implement any sort
   of report upload retry mechanism.  By design, the protocol in this
   document is robust against individual Client upload failures since
   the protocol output is an aggregate over all inputs.

6.1.2.  Aggregator Capabilities

   Leaders and Helpers have different operational requirements.  The
   design in this document assumes an operationally competent Leader,
   i.e., one that has no storage or computation limitations or
   constraints, but only a modestly provisioned Helper, i.e., one that
   has computation, bandwidth, and storage constraints.  By design,
   Leaders must be at least as capable as Helpers, where Helpers are
   generally required to:

   *  Support the aggregate interaction, which includes validating and
      aggregating reports; and

   *  Publish and manage an HPKE configuration that can be used for the
      upload interaction.

   In addition, for each DAP task, the Helper is required to:

   *  Implement some form of batch-to-report index, as well as inter-
      and intra-batch replay mitigation storage, which includes some way
      of tracking batch report size.  Some of this state may be used for
      replay attack mitigation.  The replay mitigation strategy is
      described in Section 4.8.1.4.

   Beyond the minimal capabilities required of Helpers, Leaders are
   generally required to:

   *  Support the upload interaction and store reports; and

   *  Track batch report size during each collect flow and request
      encrypted output shares from Helpers.

   In addition, for each DAP task, the Leader is required to:

   *  Implement and store state for the form of inter- and intra-batch
      replay mitigation in Figure 2.  This requires storing the report
      IDs of all reports processed for a given task.  Implementations
      may find it helpful to track additional information, like the
      timestamp, so that the storage used for anti-replay can be sharded
      efficiently.

6.1.3.  Collector Capabilities

   Collectors statefully interact with Aggregators to produce an
   aggregate output.  Their input to the protocol is the task
   parameters, configured out of band, which include the corresponding
   batch window and size.  For each collect invocation, Collectors are
   required to keep state from the start of the protocol to the end as
   needed to produce the final aggregate output.

   Collectors must also maintain state for the lifetime of each task,
   which includes key material associated with the HPKE key
   configuration.

6.2.  VDAFs and Compute Requirements

   The choice of VDAF can impact the computation and storage required
   for a DAP task:

   *  The runtime of VDAF sharding and preparation is related to the
      "size" of the underlying measurements.  For example, the
      Prio3SumVec VDAF defined in Section 7 of [VDAF] requires each
      measurement to be a vector of the same length, which all parties
      need to agree on prior to VDAF execution.  The computation
      required for such tasks increases linearly as a function of the
      chosen length, as each vector element must be processed in turn.

   *  The runtime of VDAF preparation is related to the size of the
      aggregation parameter.  For example for Poplar1 defined in
      Section 8 of [VDAF], preparation takes as input a sequence of so-
      called "candidate prefixes", and the amount of computation is
      linear in the number of prefixes.

   *  The storage requirements for aggregate shares vary depending on
      the size of the measurements and/or the aggregation parameter.

   To account for these factors, care must be taken that a DAP
   deployment can handle VDAF execution of all possible configurations
   for any tasks which the deployment may be configured for.  Otherwise,
   an attacker may deny service by uploading many expensive reports to a
   suitably-configured VDAF.

   The varying cost of VDAF computation means that Aggregators should
   negotiate reasonable limits for each VDAF configuration, out of band
   with the protocol.  For example, Aggregators may agree on a maximum
   size for an aggregation job or on a maximum rate of incoming reports.

   Applications which require computationally-expensive VDAFs can
   mitigate the computation cost of aggregation in a few ways, such as
   producing aggregates over a sample of the data or choosing a
   representation of the data permitting a simpler aggregation scheme.

6.3.  Aggregation Utility and Soft Batch Deadlines

   A soft real-time system should produce a response within a deadline
   to be useful.  This constraint may be relevant when the value of an
   aggregate decreases over time.  A missed deadline can reduce an
   aggregate's utility but not necessarily cause failure in the system.

   An example of a soft real-time constraint is the expectation that
   input data can be verified and aggregated in a period equal to data
   collection, given some computational budget.  Meeting these deadlines
   will require efficient implementations of the VDAF.  Applications
   might batch requests or utilize more efficient serialization to
   improve throughput.

   Some applications may be constrained by the time that it takes to
   reach a privacy threshold defined by a minimum number of reports.
   One possible solution is to increase the reporting period so more
   samples can be collected, balanced against the urgency of responding
   to a soft deadline.

6.4.  Protocol-specific Optimizations

   Not all DAP tasks have the same operational requirements, so the
   protocol is designed to allow implementations to reduce operational
   costs in certain cases.

6.4.1.  Reducing Storage Requirements

   In general, the Aggregators are required to keep state for tasks and
   all valid reports for as long as collection requests can be made for
   them.  However, it is not necessary to store the complete reports.
   Each Aggregator only needs to store an aggregate share for each
   possible batch bucket i.e., the batch interval for time-interval or
   batch ID for leader-selected, along with a flag indicating whether
   the aggregate share has been collected.  This is due to the
   requirement for queries to respect bucket boundaries.  See
   Section 4.9.5.

   However, Aggregators are also required to implement several per-
   report checks that require retaining a number of data artifacts.  For
   example, to detect replay attacks, it is necessary for each
   Aggregator to retain the set of report IDs of reports that have been
   aggregated for the task so far.  Depending on the task lifetime and
   report upload rate, this can result in high storage costs.  To
   alleviate this burden, DAP allows Aggregators to drop this state as
   needed, so long as reports are dropped properly as described in
   Section 4.8.1.4.  Aggregators SHOULD take steps to mitigate the risk
   of dropping reports (e.g., by evicting the oldest data first).

   Furthermore, the Aggregators must store data related to a task as
   long as the current time has not passed this task's end time
   task_start + task_duration.  Aggregator MAY delete the task and all
   data pertaining to this task after the end time.  Implementors SHOULD
   provide for some leeway so the Collector can collect the batch after
   some delay.

6.4.2.  Distributed-systems and Synchronization Concerns

   Various parts of a DAP implementation will need to synchronize in
   order to ensure correctness during concurrent operation.  This
   section describes the relevant concerns and makes suggestions as to
   potential implementation tradeoffs.

   *  The upload interaction requires the Leader to ignore uploaded
      reports with a duplicated ID, including concurrently-uploaded
      reports.  This might be implemented by synchronization or via an
      eventually-consistent process.  If the Leader wishes to alert the
      Client with a reportRejected error, synchronization will be
      necessary to ensure all but one concurrent request receive the
      error.

   *  The Leader is responsible for generating aggregation jobs, and
      will generally want to place each report in exactly one
      aggregation job.  (The only event in which a Leader will want to
      place a report in multiple aggregation jobs is if the Helper
      rejects the report with report_too_early, in which case the Leader
      can place the report into a later aggregation job.)  This may
      require synchronization between different components of the system
      which are generating aggregation jobs.  Note that placing a report
      into more than one aggregation job will result in a loss of
      throughput, rather than a loss of correctness, privacy, or
      robustness, so it is acceptable for implementations to use an
      eventually-consistent scheme which may rarely place a report into
      multiple aggregation jobs.

   *  Aggregation is implemented as a sequence of aggregation steps by
      both the Leader and the Helper.  The Leader must ensure that each
      aggregation job is only processed once concurrently, which may
      require synchronization between the components responsible for
      performing aggregation.  The Helper must ensure that concurrent
      requests against the same aggregation job are handled
      appropriately, which requires synchronization between the
      components handling aggregation requests.

   *  Aggregation requires checking and updating used-report storage as
      part of implementing replay protection.  This must be done while
      processing the aggregation job, though which steps the checks are
      performed at is up to the implementation.  The checks and storage
      require synchronization, so that if two aggregation jobs
      contianing the same report are processed, at most one instance of
      the report will be aggregated.  However, the interaction with the
      used-report storage does not necessarily have to be synchronized
      with the processing and storage for the remainder of the
      aggregation process.  For example, used-report storage could be
      implemented in a separate datastore than is used for the remainder
      of data storage, without any transactionality between updates to
      the two datastores.

   *  The aggregation and collection interactions require
      synchronization to avoid modifying the aggregate of a batch after
      it has already been collected.  Any reports being aggregated which
      pertain to a batch which has already been collected must fail with
      a batch_collected error; correctly determining this requires
      synchronizing aggregation with the completion of collection jobs
      (for the Leader) or aggregate share requests (for the Helper).
      Also, the Leader must complete all outstanding aggregation jobs
      for a batch before requesting aggregate shares from the Helper,
      again requiring synchronization between the Leader's collection
      and aggregation interactions.  Further, the Helper must determine
      the aggregated report count and checksum of aggregated report IDs
      before responding to an aggregate share request, requiring
      synchronization between the Helper's collection and aggregation
      interactions.

7.  Compliance Requirements

   In the absence of an application or deployment-specific profile
   specifying otherwise, a compliant DAP application MUST implement the
   following HPKE cipher suite:

   *  KEM: DHKEM(X25519, HKDF-SHA256) (see [HPKE], Section 7.1)

   *  KDF: HKDF-SHA256 (see [HPKE], Section 7.2)

   *  AEAD: AES-128-GCM (see [HPKE], Section 7.3)

8.  Security Considerations

   DAP aims to achieve the privacy and robustness security goals defined
   in Section 9 of [VDAF], even in the presence of an active attacker.
   It is assumed that the attacker may control the network and have the
   ability to control a subset of of Clients, one of the Aggregators,
   and the Collector for a given task.

   In the presence of this adversary, there are some threats DAP does
   not defend against and which are considered outside of DAP's threat
   model.  These are enumerated below, along with potential mitigations.

   Attacks on robustness:

   1.  Aggregators can defeat robustness by emitting incorrect aggregate
       shares, by omitting reports from the aggregation process, or by
       manipulating the VDAF preparation process for a single report.
       DAP follows VDAF in providing robustness only if both Aggregators
       honestly follow the protocol.

   2.  Clients may affect the quality of aggregate results by reporting
       false measurements.  A VDAF can only verify that a submitted
       measurement is valid, not that it is true.

   3.  An attacker can impersonate multiple Clients, or a single
       malicious Client can upload an unexpectedly-large number of
       reports, in order to skew aggregate results or to reduce the
       number of measurements from honest Clients in a batch below the
       minimum batch size.  See Section 8.1 for discussion and potential
       mitigations.

   Attacks on privacy:

   1.  Clients can intentionally leak their own measurements and
       compromise their own privacy.

   2.  Both Aggregators together can, purposefully or accidentally,
       share unencrypted input shares in order to defeat the privacy of
       individual reports.  DAP follows VDAF in providing privacy only
       if at least one Aggregator honestly follows the protocol.

   Attacks on other properties of the system:

   1.  Both Aggregators together can, purposefully or accidentally,
       share unencrypted aggregate shares in order to reveal the
       aggregation result for a given batch.

   2.  Aggregators, or a passive network attacker between the Clients
       and the Leader, can examine metadata such as HTTP client IP in
       order to infer which Clients are submitting reports.  Depending
       on the particulars of the deployment, this may be used to infer
       sensitive information about the Client.  This can be mitigated
       for the Aggregator by deploying an anonymizing proxy (see
       Section 8.4), or in general by requiring Clients to submit
       reports at regular intervals independently of the measurement
       value such that the existence of a report does not imply the
       occurrence of a sensitive event.

   3.  Aggregators can deny service by refusing to respond to collection
       requests or aggregate share requests.

   4.  Some VDAFs could leak information to either Aggregator or the
       Collector beyond what the protocol intended to learn.  It may be
       possible to mitigate such leakages using differential privacy
       (Section 8.5).

8.1.  Sybil Attacks

   Several attacks on privacy or robustness involve malicious Clients
   uploading reports that are valid under the chosen VDAF but incorrect.

   For example, a DAP deployment might be measuring the heights of a
   human population and configure a variant of Prio3 to prove that
   measurements are values in the range of 80-250 cm.  A malicious
   Client would not be able to claim a height of 400 cm, but they could
   submit multiple bogus reports inside the acceptable range, which
   would yield incorrect averages.  More generally, DAP deployments are
   susceptible to Sybil attacks [Dou02], especially when carried out by
   the Leader.

   In this type of attack, the adversary adds to a batch a number of
   reports that skew the aggregate result in its favor.  For example,
   sending known measurements to the Aggregators can allow a Collector
   to shrink the effective anonymity set by subtracting the known
   measurements from the aggregate result.  The result may reveal
   additional information about the honest measurements, leading to a
   privacy violation; or the result may have some property that is
   desirable to the adversary ("stats poisoning").

   Depending on the deployment and the specific threat being mitigated,
   there are different ways to address Sybil attacks, such as:

   1.  Implementing Client authentication, as described in Section 8.3,
       likely paired with rate-limiting uploads from individual Clients.

   2.  Removing Client-specific metadata on individual reports, such as
       through the use of anonymizing proxies in the upload flow, as
       described in Section 8.4.

   3.  Some mechanisms for differential privacy (Section 8.5) can help
       mitigate Sybil attacks against privacy to some extent.

8.2.  Batch-selection Attacks

   Depending on the batch mode, the privacy of an individual Client may
   be infringed upon by selection of the batch.  For example, in the
   leader-selected batch mode, the Leader is free to select the reports
   that compose a given batch almost arbitrarily; a malicious Leader
   might choose a batch composed of reports arriving from a single
   client.  The aggregate derived from this batch might then reveal
   information about that Client.

   The mitigations for this attack are similar to those used for Sybil
   attacks (Section 8.1):

   1.  Implementing Client authentication, as described in Section 8.3,
       and having each aggregator verify that each batch contains
       reports from a suitable number of distinct clients.

   2.  Disassociating each report from the Client which generated it,
       via the use of anonymizing proxies (Section 8.4) or similar
       techniques.

   3.  Differential privacy (Section 8.5) can help mitigate the impact
       of this attack.

   4.  Deployment-specific mitigations may also be possible: for
       example, if every Client is sending reports at a given rate, it
       may be possible for aggregators to bound the accepted age of
       reports such that the number of aggregatable reports from a given
       Client is small enough to effectively mitigate this attack.

8.3.  Client Authentication

   In settings where it is practical for each Client to have an identity
   provisioned (e.g., a user logged into a backend service or a hardware
   device programmed with an identity), Client authentication can help
   Aggregators (or an authenticating proxy deployed between Clients and
   the Aggregators; see Section 8.4) ensure that all reports come from
   authentic Clients.  Note that because the Helper never handles
   messages directly from the Clients, reports would need to include an
   extension (Section 4.7.3) to convey authentication information to the
   Helper.  For example, a deployment might include a Privacy Pass token
   ([I-D.draft-ietf-privacypass-architecture-16]) in a report extension
   to allow both Aggregators to independently verify the Client's
   identity.

   However, in some deployments, it will not be practical to require
   Clients to authenticate, so Client authentication is not mandatory in
   DAP.  For example, a widely distributed application that does not
   require its users to log in to any service has no obvious way to
   authenticate its report uploads.

8.4.  Anonymizing Proxies

   Client reports may be transmitted alongside auxiliary information
   such as source IP, HTTP user agent, or Client authentication
   information (in deployments which use it, see Section 8.3).  This
   metadata can be used by Aggregators to identify participating Clients
   or permit some attacks on robustness.  This auxiliary information can
   be removed by having Clients submit reports to an anonymizing proxy
   server which would then use Oblivious HTTP [RFC9458] to forward
   reports to the DAP Leader.  In this scenario, Client authentication
   would be performed by the proxy rather than any of the participants
   in the DAP protocol.

   The report itself may contain deanonmyizing information that cannot
   be removed by a proxy:

   *  The report timestamp indicates when a report was generated and may
      help an attacker to deduce which Client generated it.  Truncating
      this timestamp as described in Section 4.5 can help.

   *  The public extensions may help the attacker to profile the
      Client's configuration.

8.5.  Differential Privacy

   DAP deployments can choose to ensure their aggregate results achieve
   differential privacy ([Vad16]).  A simple approach would require the
   Aggregators to add two-sided noise (e.g. sampled from a two-sided
   geometric distribution) to aggregate shares.  Since each Aggregator
   is adding noise independently, privacy can be guaranteed even if all
   but one of the Aggregators is malicious.  Differential privacy is a
   strong privacy definition, and protects users in extreme
   circumstances: even if an adversary has prior knowledge of every
   measurement in a batch except for one, that one measurement is still
   formally protected.

8.6.  Task Parameters

   Distribution of DAP task parameters is out of band from DAP itself
   and thus not discussed in this document.  This section examines the
   security tradeoffs involved in the selection of the DAP task
   parameters.  Generally, attacks involving crafted DAP task parameters
   can be mitigated by having the Aggregators refuse shared parameters
   that are trivially insecure (e.g., a minimum batch size of 1 report).

8.6.1.  VDAF Verification Key Requirements

   Knowledge of the verification key would allow a Client to forge a
   report with invalid values that will nevertheless pass verification.
   Therefore, the verification key must be kept secret from Clients.

   Furthermore, for a given report, it may be possible to craft a
   verification key which leaks information about that report's
   measurement during VDAF preparation.  Therefore, the verification key
   for a task SHOULD be chosen before any reports are generated.
   Moreover, it SHOULD be fixed for the lifetime of the task and not be
   rotated.  One way to ensure that the verification key is generated
   independently from any given report is to derive the key based on the
   task ID and some previously agreed upon secret (verify_key_seed)
   between Aggregators, as follows:

   verify_key = HKDF-Expand(
       HKDF-Extract(
           "verify_key",    # salt
           verify_key_seed, # IKM
       ),
       task_id,             # info
       VERIFY_KEY_SIZE,     # L
   )

   Here, VERIFY_KEY_SIZE is the length of the verification key, and
   HKDF-Extract and HKDF-Expand are as defined in [RFC5869].

   This requirement comes from current security analysis for existing
   VDAFs.  In particular, the security proofs for Prio3 require that the
   verification key is chosen independently of the generated reports.

8.6.2.  Batch Parameters

   An important parameter of a DAP deployment is the minimum batch size.
   If a batch includes too few reports, then the aggregate result can
   reveal information about individual measurements.  Aggregators
   enforce the agreed-upon minimum batch size during collection, but
   implementations SHOULD also opt out of participating in a DAP task if
   the minimum batch size is too small.  This document does not specify
   how to choose an appropriate minimum batch size, but an appropriate
   value may be determined from the differential privacy (Section 8.5)
   parameters in use, if any.

8.6.3.  Task Configuration Agreement and Consistency

   In order to execute a DAP task, it is necessary for all parties to
   ensure they agree on the configuration of the task.  However, it is
   possible for a party to participate in the execution of DAP without
   knowing all of the task's parameters.  For example, a Client can
   upload a report (Section 4.7) without knowing the minimum batch size
   that is enforced by the Aggregators during collection (Section 4.9).

   Depending on the deployment model, agreement can require that task
   parameters are visible to all parties such that each party can choose
   whether to participate based on the value of any parameter.  This
   includes the parameters enumerated in Section 4.3 and any additional
   parameters implied by report extensions Section 4.7.3 used by the
   task.  Since meaningful privacy requires that multiple Clients
   contribute to a task, they should also share a consistent view of the
   task configuration.

8.7.  Infrastructure Diversity

   DAP deployments should ensure that Aggregators do not have common
   dependencies that would enable a single vendor to reassemble
   measurements.  For example, if all participating Aggregators stored
   unencrypted input shares on the same cloud object storage service,
   then that cloud vendor would be able to reassemble all the input
   shares and defeat privacy.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests registry of new media types (Section 9.1),
   creation of new codepoint registries (Section 9.2), and registration
   of an IETF URN sub-namespace (Section 9.3).

   (RFC EDITOR: In the remainder of this section, replace "RFC XXXX"
   with the RFC number assigned to this document.)

9.1.  Protocol Message Media Types

   This specification defines the following protocol messages, along
   with their corresponding media types types:

   *  HpkeConfigList Section 4.7.1: "application/dap-hpke-config-list"

   *  Report Section 4.7.2: "application/dap-report"

   *  AggregationJobInitReq Section 4.8.1.1: "application/dap-
      aggregation-job-init-req"

   *  AggregationJobResp Section 4.8.1.2: "application/dap-aggregation-
      job-resp"

   *  AggregationJobContinueReq Section 4.8.2.1: "application/dap-
      aggregation-job-continue-req"

   *  AggregateShareReq Section 4.9.2: "application/dap-aggregate-share-
      req"

   *  AggregateShare Section 4.9.2: "application/dap-aggregate-share"

   *  CollectionJobReq Section 4.9.1: "application/dap-collection-job-
      req"

   *  CollectionJobResp Section 4.9.1: "application/dap-collection-job-
      resp"

   Protocol message format evolution is supported through the definition
   of new formats that are identified by new media types.  The messages
   above are specific to this specification.  When a new major
   enhancement is proposed that results in newer IETF specification for
   DAP, a new set of media types will be defined.  In other words, newer
   versions of DAP will not be backward compatible with this version of
   DAP.

   (RFC EDITOR: Remove this paragraph.)  HTTP requests with DAP media
   types MAY express an optional parameter 'version', following
   Section 8.3 of [RFC9110].  Value of this parameter indicates current
   draft version of the protocol the component is using.  This MAY be
   used as a hint by the receiver of the request to do compatibility
   checks between client and server.  For example, A report submission
   to leader from a client that supports draft-ietf-ppm-dap-09 could
   have the header Content-Type: application/dap-report;version=09.

   The "Media Types" registry at https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-
   types will be (RFC EDITOR: replace "will be" with "has been") updated
   to include each of these media types.  The information required for
   each media type is listed in the remaining subsections.

9.2.  DAP Type Registries

   This document also requests creation of a new "Distributed
   Aggregation Protocol (DAP)" page.  This page will contain several new
   registries, described in the following sections.  All registries are
   administered under the Specification Required policy [RFC8126].

9.2.1.  Batch Modes Registry

   A new registry will be (RFC EDITOR: change "will be" to "has been")
   created called "Batch Mode Identifiers" for DAP batch modes
   (Section 4.2).  This registry should contain the following columns:

   Value:  The one-byte identifier for the batch mode

   Name:  The name of the batch mode

   Reference:  Where the batch mode is defined

   The initial contents of this registry listed in Table 2.

           +=======+=================+=========================+
           | Value | Name            | Reference               |
           +=======+=================+=========================+
           | 0x00  | reserved        | Section 4.2 of RFC XXXX |
           +-------+-----------------+-------------------------+
           | 0x01  | time_interval   | Section 5.1 of RFC XXXX |
           +-------+-----------------+-------------------------+
           | 0x02  | leader_selected | Section 5.2 of RFC XXXX |
           +-------+-----------------+-------------------------+

                Table 2: Initial contents of the Batch Mode
                           Identifiers registry.

9.2.2.  Report Extension Registry

   A new registry will be (RFC EDITOR: change "will be" to "has been")
   created called "Report Extension Identifiers" for extensions to the
   upload interaction (Section 4.7).  This registry should contain the
   following columns:

   Value:  The two-byte identifier for the upload extension

   Name:  The name of the upload extension

   Reference:  Where the upload extension is defined

   The initial contents of this registry are listed in Table 3.

                     +========+==========+===========+
                     | Value  | Name     | Reference |
                     +========+==========+===========+
                     | 0x0000 | reserved | RFC XXXX  |
                     +--------+----------+-----------+

                        Table 3: Initial contents of
                            the Report Extension
                           Identifiers registry.

9.2.3.  Report Error Registry

   A new registry will be (RFC EDITOR: change "will be" to "has been")
   created called "Report Error Identifiers" for reasons for rejecting
   reports during the aggregation interaction (Section 4.8.1.2).

   Value:  The one-byte identifier of the report error

   Name:  The name of the report error

   Reference:  Where the report error is defined

   The initial contents of this registry are listed below in Table 4.

     +=======+========================+=============================+
     | Value | Name                   | Reference                   |
     +=======+========================+=============================+
     | 0x00  | reserved               | Section 4.8.1.2 of RFX XXXX |

        Table 4: Initial contents of the Report Error Identifiers
                                registry.

9.3.  URN Sub-namespace for DAP (urn:ietf:params:ppm:dap)

   The following value will be (RFC EDITOR: change "will be" to "has
   been") registered in the "IETF URN Sub-namespace for Registered
   Protocol Parameter Identifiers" registry, following the template in
   [RFC3553]:

   Registry name:  dap

   Specification:  RFC XXXX

   Repository:  http://www.iana.org/assignments/dap

   Index value:  No transformation needed.

   The initial contents of this namespace are the types and descriptions
   in Table 1, with the Reference field set to RFC XXXX.

10.  Extending this Document

   The behavior of DAP may be extended or modified by future documents
   defining one or more of the following:

   1.  a new batch mode (Section 4.2)

   2.  a new report extension (Section 4.7.3)

   3.  a new report error (Section 4.8.1.2)

   4.  a new entry in the URN sub-namespace for DAP (Table 1)

   Each of these requires registration of a codepoint or other value;
   see Section 9.  No other considerations are required except in the
   following cases:

   *  When a document defines a new batch mode, it MUST include a
      section titled "DAP Batch Mode Considerations" specifying the
      following:

      -  The value of the config field of Query, PartialBatchSelector,
         and BatchSelector

      -  Batch buckets (Section 4.8.2.3): how reports are assigned to
         batch buckets; how each bucket is identified; and how batch
         buckets are mapped to batches.

      See Section 5 for examples.

   *  When a document defines a new report extension, it SHOULD include
      in its "Security Considerations" section some discussion of how
      the extension impacts the security of DAP with respect to the
      threat model in Section 8.
