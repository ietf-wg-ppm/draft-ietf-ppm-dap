  Distributed Aggregation Protocol for Privacy Preserving Measurement
                       draft-ietf-ppm-dap-latest

Abstract

   There are many situations in which it is desirable to take
   measurements of data which people consider sensitive.  In these
   cases, the entity taking the measurement is usually not interested in
   people's individual responses but rather in aggregated data.
   Conventional methods require collecting individual responses and then
   aggregating them, thus representing a threat to user privacy and
   rendering many such measurements difficult and impractical.  This
   document describes a multi-party distributed aggregation protocol
   (DAP) for privacy preserving measurement (PPM) which can be used to
   collect aggregate data without revealing any individual user's data.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP)
   for privacy preserving measurement.  The protocol is executed by a
   large set of clients and two aggregator servers.  The aggregators'
   goal is to compute some aggregate statistic over the clients' inputs
   without learning the inputs themselves.  This is made possible by
   distributing the computation among the aggregators in such a way
   that, as long as at least one of them executes the protocol honestly,
   no input is ever seen in the clear by any aggregator.

1.1.  Change Log

   (*) Indicates a change that breaks wire compatibility with the
   previous draft.

   12:

   *  Remove the max_batch_size parameter of the fixed-size query type.

   *  Rename the "fixed-size" query type to "leader-selected", to align
      the name with the behavior of this query type.

   *  Rename "query type" to "batch mode", to align the name of this
      configuration value with its functionality.

   *  Restore the part_batch_selector field of the Collection structure,
      which was removed in draft 11, as it is required to decrypt
      collection results in some cases. (*)

   11:

   *  Remove support for multi-collection of batches, as well as the
      fixed-size query type's by_batch_id query. (*)

   *  Clarify purpose of report ID uniqueness.

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-10" to "dap-11". (*)

   10:

   *  Editorial changes from httpdir early review.

   *  Poll collection jobs with HTTP GET instead of POST. (*)

   *  Upload reports with HTTP POST instead of PUT. (*)

   *  Clarify requirements for problem documents.

   *  Provide guidance on batch sizes when running VDAFs with non-
      trivial aggregation parameters.

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-09" to "dap-10". (*)

   09:

   *  Fixed-size queries: make the maximum batch size optional.

   *  Fixed-size queries: require current-batch queries to return
      distinct batches.

   *  Clarify requirements for compatible VDAFs.

   *  Clarify rules around creating and abandoning aggregation jobs.

   *  Recommend that all task parameters are visible to all parties.

   *  Revise security considerations section.

   *  Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-07 to 08 [VDAF]. (*)

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-07" to "dap-09". (*)

   08:

   *  Clarify requirements for initializing aggregation jobs.

   *  Add more considerations for Sybil attacks.

   *  Expand guidance around choosing the VDAF verification key.

   *  Add an error type registry for the aggregation sub-protocol.

   07:

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-06" to "dap-07".  This is a bug-fix
      revision: the editors overlooked some changes we intended to pick
      up in the previous version. (*)

   06:

   *  Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-06 to 07 [VDAF]. (*)

   *  Overhaul security considerations (#488).

   *  Adopt revised ping-pong interface in draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-07
      (#494).

   *  Add aggregation parameter to AggregateShareAad (#498). (*)

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-05" to "dap-06". (*)

   05:

   *  Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-05 to 06 [VDAF]. (*)

   *  Specialize the protocol for two-party VDAFs (i.e., one Leader and
      One Helper).  Accordingly, update the aggregation sub-protocol to
      use the new "ping-pong" interface for two-party VDAFs introduced
      in draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-06. (*)

   *  Allow the following actions to be safely retried: aggregation job
      creation, collection job creation, and requesting the Helper's
      aggregate share.

   *  Merge error types that are related.

   *  Drop recommendation to generate IDs using a cryptographically
      secure pseudorandom number generator wherever pseudorandomness is
      not required.

   *  Require HPKE config identifiers to be unique.

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-04" to "dap-05". (*)

   04:

   *  Introduce resource oriented HTTP API. (#278, #398, #400) (*)

   *  Clarify security requirements for choosing VDAF verify key. (#407,
      #411)

   *  Require Clients to provide nonce and random input when sharding
      inputs. (#394, #425) (*)

   *  Add interval of time spanned by constituent reports to Collection
      message. (#397, #403) (*)

   *  Update share validation requirements based on latest security
      analysis. (#408, #410)

   *  Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-03 to 05 [VDAF]. (#429) (*)

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-03" to "dap-04". (#424) (*)

   03:

   *  Enrich the "fixed_size" query type to allow the Collector to
      request a recently aggregated batch without knowing the batch ID
      in advance.  ID discovery was previously done out-of-band. (*)

   *  Allow Aggregators to advertise multiple HPKE configurations. (*)

   *  Clarify requirements for enforcing anti-replay.  Namely, while it
      is sufficient to detect repeated report IDs, it is also enough to
      detect repeated IDs and timestamps.

   *  Remove the extensions from the Report and add extensions to the
      plaintext payload of each ReportShare. (*)

   *  Clarify that extensions are mandatory to implement: If an
      Aggregator does not recognize a ReportShare's extension, it must
      reject it.

   *  Clarify that Aggregators must reject any ReportShare with repeated
      extension types.

   *  Specify explicitly how to serialize the Additional Authenticated
      Data (AAD) string for HPKE encryption.  This clarifies an
      ambiguity in the previous version. (*)

   *  Change the length tag for the aggregation parameter to 32 bits.
      (*)

   *  Use the same prefix ("application") for all media types. (*)

   *  Make input share validation more explicit, including adding a new
      ReportShareError variant, "report_too_early", for handling reports
      too far in the future. (*)

   *  Improve alignment of problem details usage with [RFC7807].
      Replace "reportTooLate" problem document type with
      "repjortRejected" and clarify handling of rejected reports in the
      upload sub-protocol. (*)

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-02" to "dap-03". (*)

   02:

   *  Define a new task configuration parameter, called the "query
      type", that allows tasks to partition reports into batches in
      different ways.  In the current draft, the Collector specifies a
      "query", which the Aggregators use to guide selection of the
      batch.  Two query types are defined: the "time_interval" type
      captures the semantics of draft 01; and the "fixed_size" type
      allows the Leader to partition the reports arbitrarily, subject to
      the constraint that each batch is roughly the same size. (*)

   *  Define a new task configuration parameter, called the task
      "expiration", that defines the lifetime of a given task.

   *  Specify requirements for HTTP request authentication rather than a
      concrete scheme.  (Draft 01 required the use of the DAP-Auth-Token
      header; this is now optional.)

   *  Make "task_id" an optional parameter of the "/hpke_config"
      endpoint.

   *  Add report count to CollectResp message. (*)

   *  Increase message payload sizes to accommodate VDAFs with input and
      aggregate shares larger than 2^16-1 bytes. (*)

   *  Bump draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-01 to 03 [VDAF]. (*)

   *  Bump version tag from "dap-01" to "dap-02". (*)

   *  Rename the report nonce to the "report ID" and move it to the top
      of the structure. (*)

   *  Clarify when it is safe for an Aggregator to evict various data
      artifacts from long-term storage.

1.2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Aggregate result:  The output of the aggregation function computed
      over a batch of measurements and an aggregation parameter.  As
      defined in [VDAF].

   Aggregate share:  A share of the aggregate result emitted by an
      Aggregator.  Aggregate shares are reassembled by the Collector
      into the aggregate result, which is the final output of the
      aggregation function.  As defined in [VDAF].

   Aggregation function:  The function computed over the Clients'
      measurements.  As defined in [VDAF].

   Aggregation parameter:  Parameter used to prepare a set of
      measurements for aggregation.  As defined in [VDAF].

   Aggregator:  A server that receives input shares from Clients and
      validates and aggregates them with the help of the other
      Aggregators.

   Batch:  A set of reports (i.e., measurements) that are aggregated
      into an aggregate result.

   Batch duration:  The time difference between the oldest and newest
      report in a batch.

   Batch interval:  A parameter of a query issued by the Collector that
      specifies the time range of the reports in the batch.

   Client:  The DAP protocol role identifying a party that uploads a
      report.  Note the distinction between a DAP Client (distinguished
      in this document by the capital "C") and an HTTP client
      (distinguished in this document by the phrase HTTP client), as the
      DAP Client is not the only role that sometimes acts as an HTTP
      client.

   Collector:  The party that selects the aggregation parameter and
      receives the aggregate result.

   Helper:  The Aggregator that executes the aggregation and collection
      interactions as instructed by the Leader.

   Input share:  An Aggregator's share of a measurement.  The input
      shares are output by the VDAF sharding algorithm.  As defined in
      [VDAF].

   Output share:  An Aggregator's share of the refined measurement
      resulting from successful execution of the VDAF preparation phase.
      Many output shares are combined into an aggregate share during the
      VDAF aggregation phase.  As defined in [VDAF].

   Leader:  The Aggregator that coordinates aggregation and collection
      with the Helper.

   Measurement:  A plaintext input emitted by a Client (e.g., a count,
      summand, or string), before any encryption or secret sharing is
      applied.  Depending on the VDAF in use, multiple values may be
      grouped into a single measurement.  As defined in [VDAF].

   Minimum batch size:  The minimum number of reports in a batch.

   Public share:  The output of the VDAF sharding algorithm broadcast to
      each of the Aggregators.  As defined in [VDAF].

   Report:  A cryptographically protected measurement uploaded to the
      Leader by a Client.  Comprised of a set of report shares.

   Report Share:  An encrypted input share comprising a piece of a
      report.

2.  Overview

   The protocol is executed by a large set of Clients and a pair of
   servers referred to as "Aggregators".  Each Client's input to the
   protocol is its measurement (or set of measurements, e.g., counts of
   some user behavior).  Given the input set of measurements x_1, ...,
   x_n held by n Clients, and an aggregation parameter p shared by the
   Aggregators, the goal of DAP is to compute y = F(p, x_1, ..., x_n)
   for some function F while revealing nothing else about the
   measurements.  We call F the "aggregation function".

   This protocol is extensible and allows for the addition of new
   cryptographic schemes that implement the VDAF interface specified in
   [VDAF].  This protocol only supports VDAFs which require a single
   collection to provide useful results.

   VDAFs rely on secret sharing to protect the privacy of the
   measurements.  Rather than sending its input in the clear, each
   Client shards its measurement into a pair of "input shares" and sends
   an input share to each of the Aggregators.  This provides two
   important properties:

   *  Given only one of the input shares, it is impossible to deduce the
      plaintext measurement from which it was generated.

   *  It allows the Aggregators to compute the aggregation function by
      first aggregating up their input shares locally into "aggregate
      shares", then combining the aggregate shares into the aggregate
      result.

                       Figure 1: System Architecture

   The main participants in the protocol are as follows:

   Collector:  The entity which wants to obtain the aggregate of the
      measurements generated by the Clients.  Any given measurement task
      will have a single Collector.

   Client(s):  The parties which directly take the measurement(s) and
      report them to the DAP protocol.  In order to provide reasonable
      levels of privacy, there must be a large number of Clients.

   Aggregator:  A server which receives report shares.  Each Aggregator
      works with its co-Aggregator to compute the aggregate result.  Any
      given measurement task will have two Aggregators: a Leader and a
      Helper.

   Leader:  The Aggregator responsible for coordinating the protocol.
      It receives the reports, splits them into report shares,
      distributes the report shares to the Helper, and orchestrates the
      process of computing the aggregate result as requested by the
      Collector.

   Helper:  The Aggregator assisting the Leader with the computation.
      The protocol is designed so that the Helper is relatively
      lightweight, with most of the operational burden borne by the
      Leader.

   The basic unit of DAP is the "task" which represents a single
   measurement process (though potentially aggregating multiple batches
   of measurements).  The definition of a task includes the following
   parameters:

   *  The type of each measurement.

   *  The aggregation function to compute (e.g., sum, mean, etc.).

   *  The set of Aggregators and necessary cryptographic keying material
      to use.

   *  The VDAF to execute, which to some extent is dictated by the
      previous choices.

   *  The minimum "batch size" of reports which can be aggregated.

   *  The rate at which measurements can be taken, i.e., the "minimum
      batch duration".

   These parameters are distributed to the Clients, Aggregators, and
   Collector before the task begins.  This document does not specify a
   distribution mechanism, but it is important that all protocol
   participants agree on the task's configuration.  Each task is
   identified by a unique 32-byte ID which is used to refer to it in
   protocol messages.

   During the lifetime of a task, each Client records its own
   measurement value(s), packages them up into a report, and sends them
   to the Leader.  Each share is separately encrypted for each
   Aggregator so that even though they pass through the Leader, the
   Leader is unable to see or modify them.  Depending on the task, the
   Client may only send one report or may send many reports over time.

   The Leader distributes the shares to the Helper and orchestrates the
   process of verifying them (see Section 2.2) and assembling them into
   a final aggregate result for the Collector.  Depending on the VDAF,
   it may be possible to incrementally process each report as it comes
   in, or may be necessary to wait until the entire batch of reports is
   received.

2.2.  Validating Inputs

   An essential task of any data collection pipeline is ensuring that
   the data being aggregated is "valid".  In DAP, input validation is
   complicated by the fact that none of the entities other than the
   Client ever sees that Client's plaintext measurement.

   In order to address this problem, the Aggregators engage in a secure,
   multi-party computation specified by the chosen VDAF [VDAF] in order
   to prepare a report for aggregation.  At the beginning of this
   computation, each Aggregator is in possession of an input share
   uploaded by the Client.  At the end of the computation, each
   Aggregator is in possession of either an "output share" that is ready
   to be aggregated or an indication that a valid output share could not
   be computed.

   To facilitate this computation, the input shares generated by the
   Client include information used by the Aggregators during aggregation
   in order to validate their corresponding output shares.  For example,
   Prio3 includes a zero-knowledge proof of the input's validity (see
   Section 7.1 of [VDAF]). which the Aggregators can jointly verify and
   reject the report if it cannot be verified.  However, they do not
   learn anything about the individual report other than that it is
   valid.

   The specific properties attested to in the proof vary depending on
   the measurement being taken.  For instance, to measure the time the
   user took performing a given task the proof might demonstrate that
   the value reported was within a certain range (e.g., 0-60 seconds).
   By contrast, to report which of a set of N options the user select,
   the report might contain N integers and the proof would demonstrate
   that N-1 were 0 and the other was 1.

   It is important to recognize that "validity" is distinct from
   "correctness".  For instance, the user might have spent 30s on a task
   but the Client might report 60s.  This is a problem with any
   measurement system and DAP does not attempt to address it; it merely
   ensures that the data is within acceptable limits, so the Client
   could not report 10^6s or -20s.

3.  Message Transport

   Communications between DAP participants are carried over HTTP
   [RFC9110].  Use of HTTPS is REQUIRED to provide server authentication
   and confidentiality.

3.1.  HTTPS Request Authentication

   DAP is made up of several interactions in which different subsets of
   the protocol's participants interact with each other.

   In those cases where a channel between two participants is tunneled
   through another protocol participant, DAP mandates the use of public-
   key encryption using [HPKE] to ensure that only the intended
   recipient can see a message in the clear.

   In other cases, DAP requires HTTP client authentication as well as
   server authentication.  Any authentication scheme that is composable
   with HTTP is allowed.  For example:

   *  [OAuth2] credentials are presented in an Authorization HTTP
      header, which can be added to any DAP protocol message.

   *  TLS client certificates can be used to authenticate the underlying
      transport.

   *  The DAP-Auth-Token HTTP header described in
      [I-D.draft-dcook-ppm-dap-interop-test-design-04].

   This flexibility allows organizations deploying DAP to use existing
   well-known HTTP authentication mechanisms that they already support.
   Discovering what authentication mechanisms are supported by a DAP
   participant is outside of this document's scope.

3.2.  Errors

   Errors can be reported in DAP both as HTTP status codes and as
   problem detail objects [RFC9457] in the response body.  For example,
   if the HTTP client sends a request using a method not allowed in this
   document, then the server MAY return HTTP status 405 Method Not
   Allowed.

   When the server responds with an error status code, it SHOULD provide
   additional information using a problem detail object.  If the
   response body does consist of a problem detail object, the HTTP
   status code MUST indicate a client or server error (the 4xx or 5xx
   classes, respectively, from Section 15 of [RFC9110]).

   To facilitate automatic response to errors, this document defines the
   following standard tokens for use in the "type" field (within the DAP
   URN namespace "urn:ietf:params:ppm:dap:error:"):

     +============================+==================================+
     | Type                       | Description                      |

     +----------------------------+----------------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   This list is not exhaustive.  The server MAY return errors set to a
   URI other than those defined above.  Servers MUST NOT use the DAP URN
   namespace for errors not listed in the appropriate IANA registry (see
   Section 8.3).  The "detail" member of the Problem Details document
   includes additional diagnostic information.

   When the task ID is known (see Section 4.4), the problem document
   SHOULD include an additional "taskid" member containing the ID
   encoded in Base 64 using the URL and filename safe alphabet with no
   padding defined in Sections 5 and 3.2 of [RFC4648].

   In the remainder of this document, the tokens in the table above are
   used to refer to error types, rather than the full URNs.  For
   example, an "error of type 'invalidMessage'" refers to an error
   document with "type" value
   "urn:ietf:params:ppm:dap:error:invalidMessage".

   This document uses the verbs "abort" and "alert with [some error
   message]" to describe how protocol participants react to various
   error conditions.  This implies HTTP status code 400 Bad Request
   unless explicitly specified otherwise.

4.  Protocol Definition

   DAP has three major interactions which need to be defined:

   *  Uploading reports from the Client to the Aggregators, specified in
      Section 4.6

   *  Computing the results for a given measurement task, specified in
      Section 4.7

   *  Collecting aggregated results, specified in Section 4.8

   Each of these interactions is defined in terms of "resources".  In
   this section we define these resources and the messages used to act
   on them.

4.1.  Message Encoding

   We use the presentation language defined in [RFC8446], Section 3 to
   define messages in the DAP protocol, with the following deviations.

   Section 3.7 of [RFC8446] defines a syntax for structure fields whose
   values are constants.  In this document, we do not use that notation,
   but use something similar to describe specific variants of structures
   containing enumerated types, described in [RFC8446], Section 3.8.

   For example, suppose we have an enumeration and a structure defined
   as follows:

   enum {
     number(0),
     string(1),
     (255)
   } ExampleEnum;

   struct {
     uint32 always_present;
     ExampleEnum type;
     select (ExampleStruct.type) {
       case number: uint32 a_number;
       case string: opaque a_string<0..10>;
     };
   } ExampleStruct;

   Then we describe the specific variant of ExampleStruct where type ==
   number with a variant block like so:

 variant {
   /* Field exists regardless of variant */
   uint32 always_present;
   ExampleEnum type = number;
   /* Only fields included in the type == number variant is described */
   uint32 a_number;
 } ExampleStruct;

   The protocol text accompanying this would explain how implementations
   should handle the always_present and a_number fields but not type.
   This does not mean that the type field of ExampleStruct can only ever
   have value number.

   This notation can also be used in structures where the enum field
   does not affect what fields are or are not present in the structure.
   For example:

   enum {
     something(0),
     something_else(1),
     (255)
   } FailureReason;

   struct {
     FailureReason failure_reason;
     opaque another_field<0..256>;
   } FailedOperation;

   The protocol text might include a description like:

   variant {
     FailureReason failure_reason = something;
     opaque another_field<0..256>;
   } FailedOperation;

   Encoding and decoding of these messages as byte strings also follows
   [RFC8446].

4.2.  Basic Type Definitions

   The following are some basic type definitions used in other messages:

/* ASCII encoded URL. e.g., "https://example.com" */
opaque Url<1..2^16-1>;

uint64 Duration; /* Number of seconds elapsed between two instants */

uint64 Time; /* seconds elapsed since start of UNIX epoch */

/* An interval of time of length duration, where start is included and (start +
duration) is excluded. */
struct {
  Time start;
  Duration duration;
} Interval;

/* An ID used to uniquely identify a report in the context of a DAP task. */
opaque ReportID[16];

/* The various roles in the DAP protocol. */
enum {
  collector(0),
  client(1),
  leader(2),
  helper(3),
  (255)
} Role;

/* Identifier for a server's HPKE configuration */
uint8 HpkeConfigId;

/* An HPKE ciphertext. */
struct {
  HpkeConfigId config_id;    /* config ID */
  opaque enc<1..2^16-1>;     /* encapsulated HPKE key */
  opaque payload<1..2^32-1>; /* ciphertext */
} HpkeCiphertext;

/* Represent a zero-length byte string. */
struct {} Empty;

   DAP uses the 16-byte ReportID as the nonce parameter for the VDAF
   shard and prep_init methods (see [VDAF], Section 5).  Additionally,
   DAP includes messages defined in the VDAF specification encoded as
   opaque byte strings within various DAP messages.  Thus, for a VDAF to
   be compatible with DAP, it MUST specify a NONCE_SIZE of 16 bytes, and
   MUST specify encodings for the following VDAF types:

   *  PublicShare

   *  InputShare

   *  AggParam

   *  AggShare

   *  PrepShare

   *  PrepMessage

4.3.  Batch Modes, Batches, and Queries

   Aggregated results are computed based on sets of reports, called
   "batches".  The Collector requests the aggregated results for a given
   batch via a "query".  The Aggregators use this query to carry out the
   aggregation flow and produce aggregate shares encrypted to the
   Collector.

   Each measurement task has a preconfigured "batch mode".  The batch
   mode defines both how reports may be partitioned into batches, as
   well as how these batches are addressed and the semantics of the
   query used for collection.

   This document defines the following batch modes:

   enum {
     reserved(0), /* Reserved for testing purposes */
     time_interval(1),
     leader_selected(2),
     (255)
   } BatchMode;

   The time-interval batch mode is described in Section 4.3.1; the
   leader-selected batch mode is described in Section 4.3.2.  Future
   specifications may introduce new batch modes as needed (see
   Section 8.2.1).  Implementations are free to implement only a subset
   of the available batch modes.

   A query includes parameters used by the Aggregators to select a batch
   of reports specific to the given batch mode.  A query is defined as
   follows:

   struct {
     BatchMode batch_mode;
     select (Query.batch_mode) {
       case time_interval: Interval batch_interval;
       case leader_selected: Empty;
     }
   } Query;

   The query is issued in-band as part of the collect interaction
   (Section 4.8).  Its content is determined by the batch mode, which in
   turn is determined by the measurement task, which is configured out-
   of-band.  All batch modes have the following configuration parameters
   in common:

   *  min_batch_size - The smallest number of reports the batch is
      allowed to include.  In a sense, this parameter controls the
      degree of privacy that will be obtained: the larger the minimum
      batch size, the higher degree of privacy.  However, this
      ultimately depends on the application and the nature of the
      measurements and aggregation function.

   *  time_precision - Clients use this value to truncate their report
      timestamps; see Section 4.6.  Additional semantics may apply,
      depending on the batch mode.  (See Section 4.8.5 for details.)

   The parameters pertaining to specific batch modes are described in
   Section 4.3.1 and Section 4.3.2.

4.3.1.  Time-interval Batch Mode

   The time-interval batch mode is designed to support applications in
   which reports are collected into batches grouped by an interval of
   time.  The Collector specifies a "batch interval" that determines the
   time range for reports included in the batch.  For each report in the
   batch, the time at which that report was generated (see Section 4.6)
   MUST fall within the batch interval specified by the Collector.

   Typically the Collector issues queries for which the batch intervals
   are continuous, monotonically increasing, and have the same duration.
   For example, the sequence of batch intervals (1659544000, 1000),
   (1659545000, 1000), (1659546000, 1000), (1659547000, 1000) satisfies
   these conditions.  (The first element of the pair denotes the start
   of the batch interval and the second denotes the duration.)  However,
   this is not a requirement--the Collector may decide to issue queries
   out-of-order.  In addition, the Collector may need to vary the
   duration to adjust to changing report upload rates.

4.3.2.  Leader-selected Batch Mode

   The leader-selected batch mode is used to support applications in
   which it is acceptable for reports to be batched in an arbitrary
   fashion by the Leader.  Each batch of reports is identified by an
   opaque "batch ID".  Both the reports included in each batch and the
   ID for each batch are allocated in an arbitrary fashion by the
   Leader.

   The Collector will not know the set of batch IDs available for
   collection.  To get the aggregate of a batch, the Collector issues a
   query, which does not include any information specifying a particular
   batch (see Section 4.3).  The Leader selects a recent batch to
   aggregate.  The Leader MUST select a batch that has not yet been
   associated with a collection job.

   The Aggregators can output batches of any size that is larger than or
   equal to min_batch_size.  The target batch size, if any, is
   implementation-specific, and may be equal to or greater than the
   minimum batch size.  Deciding how soon batches should be output is
   also implementation-specific.  Exactly sizing batches may be
   challenging for Leader deployments in which multiple, independent
   nodes running the aggregate interaction (see Section 4.7) need to be
   coordinated.

4.4.  Task Configuration

   Prior to the start of execution of the protocol, each participant
   must agree on the configuration for each task.  A task is uniquely
   identified by its task ID:

   opaque TaskID[32];

   The task ID value MUST be a globally unique sequence of bytes.  Each
   task has the following parameters associated with it:

   *  leader_aggregator_url: A URL relative to which the Leader's API
      resources can be found.

   *  helper_aggregator_url: A URL relative to which the Helper's API
      resources can be found.

   *  The batch mode for this task (see Section 4.3).  This determines
      how reports are grouped into batches and the properties that all
      batches for this task must have.  The party MUST NOT configure the
      task if it does not recognize the batch mode.

   *  task_expiration: The time up to which Clients are expected to
      upload to this task.  The task is considered completed after this
      time.  Aggregators MAY reject reports that have timestamps later
      than task_expiration.

   *  A unique identifier for the VDAF in use for the task, e.g., one of
      the VDAFs defined in Section 10 of [VDAF].

   Note that the leader_aggregator_url and helper_aggregator_url values
   may include arbitrary path components.

   In addition, in order to facilitate the aggregation and collect
   protocols, each of the Aggregators is configured with following
   parameters:

   *  collector_hpke_config: The [HPKE] configuration of the Collector
      (described in Section 4.6.1); see Section 6 for information about
      the HPKE configuration algorithms.

   *  vdaf_verify_key: The VDAF verification key shared by the
      Aggregators.  This key is used in the aggregation interaction
      (Section 4.7).  The security requirements are described in
      Section 7.6.1.

   Finally, the Collector is configured with the HPKE secret key
   corresponding to collector_hpke_config.

   A task's parameters are immutable for the lifetime of that task.  The
   only way to change parameters or to rotate secret values like
   collector HPKE configuration or the VDAF verification key is to
   configure a new task.

4.5.  Resource URIs

   DAP is defined in terms of "resources", such as reports
   (Section 4.6), aggregation jobs (Section 4.7), and collection jobs
   (Section 4.8).  Each resource has an associated URI.  Resource URIs
   are specified by a sequence of string literals and variables.
   Variables are expanded into strings according to the following rules:

   *  Variables {leader} and {helper} are replaced with the base URL of
      the Leader and Helper respectively (the base URL is defined in
      Section 4.4).

   *  Variables {task-id}, {aggregation-job-id}, and {collection-job-id}
      are replaced with the task ID (Section 4.4), aggregation job ID
      (Section 4.7.1), and collection job ID (Section 4.8.1)
      respectively.  The value MUST be encoded in its URL-safe, unpadded
      Base 64 representation as specified in Sections 5 and 3.2 of
      [RFC4648].

   For example, given a helper URL "https://example.com/api/dap", task
   ID "f0 16 34 47 36 4c cf 1b c0 e3 af fc ca 68 73 c9 c3 81 f6 4a cd f9
   02 06 62 f8 3f 46 c0 72 19 e7" and an aggregation job ID "95 ce da 51
   e1 a9 75 23 68 b0 d9 61 f9 46 61 28" (32 and 16 byte octet strings,
   represented in hexadecimal), resource URI {helper}/tasks/{task-
   id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id} would be expanded into
   https://example.com/api/dap/tasks/8BY0RzZMzxvA46_8ymhzycOB9krN-
   QIGYvg_RsByGec/aggregation_jobs/lc7aUeGpdSNosNlh-UZhKA.

4.6.  Uploading Reports

   Clients periodically upload reports to the Leader.  Each report
   contains two "report shares", one for the Leader and another for the
   Helper.  The Helper's report share is transmitted by the Leader
   during the aggregation interaction (see Section 4.7).

4.6.1.  HPKE Configuration Request

   Before the Client can upload its report to the Leader, it must know
   the HPKE configuration of each Aggregator.  See Section 6 for
   information on HPKE algorithm choices.

   Clients retrieve the HPKE configuration from each Aggregator by
   sending an HTTP GET request to {aggregator}/hpke_config.

   An Aggregator responds to well-formed requests with HTTP status code
   200 OK and an HpkeConfigList value, with media type "application/dap-
   hpke-config-list".  The HpkeConfigList structure contains one or more
   HpkeConfig structures in decreasing order of preference.  This allows
   an Aggregator to support multiple HPKE configurations simultaneously.

   HpkeConfig HpkeConfigList<10..2^16-1>;

   struct {
     HpkeConfigId id;
     HpkeKemId kem_id;
     HpkeKdfId kdf_id;
     HpkeAeadId aead_id;
     HpkePublicKey public_key;
   } HpkeConfig;

   opaque HpkePublicKey<1..2^16-1>;
   uint16 HpkeAeadId; /* Defined in [HPKE] */
   uint16 HpkeKemId;  /* Defined in [HPKE] */
   uint16 HpkeKdfId;  /* Defined in [HPKE] */

   [OPEN ISSUE: Decide whether to expand the width of the id.]

   Aggregators MUST allocate distinct id values for each HpkeConfig in
   an HpkeConfigList.

   The Client MUST abort if any of the following happen for any HPKE
   config request:

   *  the GET request did not return a valid HPKE config list;

   *  the HPKE config list is empty; or

   *  no HPKE config advertised by the Aggregator specifies a supported
      a KEM, KDF, or AEAD algorithm triple.

   Aggregators SHOULD use HTTP caching to permit client-side caching of
   this resource [RFC5861].  Aggregators SHOULD favor long cache
   lifetimes to avoid frequent cache revalidation, e.g., on the order of
   days.  Aggregators can control this cached lifetime with the Cache-
   Control header, as in this example:

     Cache-Control: max-age=86400

   Servers should choose a max-age value appropriate to the lifetime of
   their keys.  Clients SHOULD follow the usual HTTP caching [RFC9111]
   semantics for HPKE configurations.

   Note: Long cache lifetimes may result in Clients using stale HPKE
   configurations; Aggregators SHOULD continue to accept reports with
   old keys for at least twice the cache lifetime in order to avoid
   rejecting reports.

4.6.2.  Upload Request

   Clients upload reports by using an HTTP POST to {leader}/tasks/{task-
   id}/reports.  The payload is a Report, with media type "application/
   dap-report", structured as follows:

   struct {
     ReportID report_id;
     Time time;
   } ReportMetadata;

   struct {
     ReportMetadata report_metadata;
     opaque public_share<0..2^32-1>;
     HpkeCiphertext leader_encrypted_input_share;
     HpkeCiphertext helper_encrypted_input_share;
   } Report;

   *  report_metadata is public metadata describing the report.

      -  report_id is used by the Aggregators to ensure the report
         appears in at most one batch (see Section 4.7.1.4).  The Client
         MUST generate this by generating 16 random bytes using a
         cryptographically secure random number generator.

      -  time is the time at which the report was generated.  The Client
         SHOULD round this value down to the nearest multiple of the
         task's time_precision in order to ensure that that the
         timestamp cannot be used to link a report back to the Client
         that generated it.

   *  public_share is the public share output by the VDAF sharding
      algorithm.  Note that the public share might be empty, depending
      on the VDAF.

   *  leader_encrypted_input_share is the Leader's encrypted input
      share.

   *  helper_encrypted_input_share is the Helper's encrypted input
      share.

   Aggregators MAY require Clients to authenticate when uploading
   reports (see Section 7.3).  If it is used, HTTP client authentication
   MUST use a scheme that meets the requirements in Section 3.1.

   The handling of the upload request by the Leader MUST be idempotent
   as discussed in Section 9.2.2 of [RFC9110].

   To generate a report, the Client begins by sharding its measurement
   into input shares and the public share using the VDAF's sharding
   algorithm (Section 5.1 of [VDAF]), using the report ID as the nonce:

   (public_share, input_shares) = Vdaf.shard(
       measurement, /* plaintext measurement */
       report_id,   /* nonce */
       rand,        /* randomness for sharding algorithm */
   )

   The last input comprises the randomness consumed by the sharding
   algorithm.  The sharding randomness is a random byte string of length
   specified by the VDAF.  The Client MUST generate this using a
   cryptographically secure random number generator.

   The sharding algorithm will return two input shares.  The first input
   share returned from the sharding algorithm is considered to be the
   Leader's input share, and the second input share is considered to be
   the Helper's input share.

   The Client then wraps each input share in the following structure:

   struct {
     Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
     opaque payload<1..2^32-1>;
   } PlaintextInputShare;

   Field extensions is set to the list of extensions intended to be
   consumed by the given Aggregator.  (See Section 4.6.3.)  Field
   payload is set to the Aggregator's input share output by the VDAF
   sharding algorithm.

   Next, the Client encrypts each PlaintextInputShare
   plaintext_input_share as follows:

   enc, payload = SealBase(pk,
     "dap-11 input share" || 0x01 || server_role,
     input_share_aad, plaintext_input_share)

   where pk is the Aggregator's public key; 0x01 represents the Role of
   the sender (always the Client); server_role is the Role of the
   intended recipient (0x02 for the Leader and 0x03 for the Helper),
   plaintext_input_share is the Aggregator's PlaintextInputShare, and
   input_share_aad is an encoded message of type InputShareAad defined
   below, constructed from the same values as the corresponding fields
   in the report.  The SealBase() function is as specified in [HPKE],
   Section 6.1 for the ciphersuite indicated by the HPKE configuration.

   struct {
     TaskID task_id;
     ReportMetadata report_metadata;
     opaque public_share<0..2^32-1>;
   } InputShareAad;

   The Leader responds to well-formed requests with HTTP status code 201
   Created.  Malformed requests are handled as described in Section 3.2.
   Clients SHOULD NOT upload the same measurement value in more than one
   report if the Leader responds with HTTP status code 201 Created.

   If the Leader does not recognize the task ID, then it MUST abort with
   error unrecognizedTask.

   The Leader responds to requests whose Leader encrypted input share
   uses an out-of-date or unknown HpkeConfig.id value, indicated by
   HpkeCiphertext.config_id, with error of type 'outdatedConfig'.  When
   the Client receives an 'outdatedConfig' error, it SHOULD invalidate
   any cached HpkeConfigList and retry with a freshly generated Report.
   If this retried upload does not succeed, the Client SHOULD abort and
   discontinue retrying.

   If a report's ID matches that of a previously uploaded report, the
   Leader MUST ignore it.  In addition, it MAY alert the Client with
   error reportRejected.  See the implementation note in
   Section 4.7.1.4.

   The Leader MUST ignore any report pertaining to a batch that has
   already been collected (see Section 4.7.1.4 for details).  Otherwise,
   comparing the aggregate result to the previous aggregate result may
   result in a privacy violation.  Note that this is also enforced by
   the Helper during the aggregation interaction.  The Leader MAY also
   abort the upload protocol and alert the Client with error
   reportRejected.

   The Leader MAY ignore any report whose timestamp is past the task's
   task_expiration.  When it does so, it SHOULD also abort the upload
   protocol and alert the Client with error reportRejected.  Client MAY
   choose to opt out of the task if its own clock has passed
   task_expiration.

   The Leader may need to buffer reports while waiting to aggregate them
   (e.g., while waiting for an aggregation parameter from the Collector;
   see Section 4.8).  The Leader SHOULD NOT accept reports whose
   timestamps are too far in the future.  Implementors MAY provide for
   some small leeway, usually no more than a few minutes, to account for
   clock skew.  If the Leader rejects a report for this reason, it
   SHOULD abort the upload protocol and alert the Client with error
   reportTooEarly.  In this situation, the Client MAY re-upload the
   report later on.

   If the Leader's input share contains an unrecognized extension, or if
   two extensions have the same ExtensionType, then the Leader MAY abort
   the upload request with error "invalidMessage".  Note that this
   behavior is not mandatory because it requires the Leader to decrypt
   its input share.

4.6.3.  Upload Extensions

   Each PlaintextInputShare carries a list of extensions that Clients
   use to convey additional information to the Aggregator.  Some
   extensions might be intended for both Aggregators; others may only be
   intended for a specific Aggregator.  (For example, a DAP deployment
   might use some out-of-band mechanism for an Aggregator to verify that
   reports come from authenticated Clients.  It will likely be useful to
   bind the extension to the input share via HPKE encryption.)

   Each extension is a tag-length encoded value of the following form:

   struct {
     ExtensionType extension_type;
     opaque extension_data<0..2^16-1>;
   } Extension;

   enum {
     TBD(0),
     (65535)
   } ExtensionType;

   Field "extension_type" indicates the type of extension, and
   "extension_data" contains information specific to the extension.

   Extensions are mandatory-to-implement: If an Aggregator receives a
   report containing an extension it does not recognize, then it MUST
   reject the report.  (See Section 4.7.1.4 for details.)

4.7.  Verifying and Aggregating Reports

   Once a set of Clients have uploaded their reports to the Leader, the
   Leader can begin the process of validating and aggregating them with
   the Helper.  To enable the system to handle large batches of reports,
   this process can be parallelized across many "aggregation jobs" in
   which small subsets of the reports are processed independently.  Each
   aggregation job is associated with exactly one DAP task, but a task
   can have many aggregation jobs.

   The primary objective of an aggregation job is to run the VDAF
   preparation process described in [VDAF], Section 5.2 for each report
   in the job.  Preparation has two purposes:

   1.  To "refine" the input shares into "output shares" that have the
       desired aggregatable form.  For some VDAFs, like Prio3, the
       mapping from input to output shares is a fixed operation
       depending only on the input share, but in general the mapping
       involves an aggregation parameter chosen by the Collector.

   2.  To verify that the output shares, when combined, correspond to a
       valid, refined measurement, where validity is determined by the
       VDAF itself.  For example, the Prio3Sum variant of Prio3
       (Section 7.4.2 of [VDAF]) requires that the output shares sum up
       to an integer in a specific range, while the Prio3Histogram
       variant (Section 7.4.4 of [VDAF]) proves that output shares sum
       up to a one-hot vector representing a contribution to a single
       bucket of the histogram.

   In general, refinement and verification are not distinct
   computations, since for some VDAFs, verification may only be achieved
   implicitly as a result of the refinement process.  We instead think
   of these as properties of the output shares themselves: if
   preparation succeeds, then the resulting output shares are guaranteed
   to combine into a valid, refined measurement.

   VDAF preparation is mapped onto an aggregation job as illustrated in
   Figure 2.  The protocol is comprised of a sequence of HTTP requests
   from the Leader to the Helper, the first of which includes the
   aggregation parameter, the Helper's report share for each report in
   the job, and for each report the initialization step for preparation.
   The Helper's response, along with each subsequent request and
   response, carries the remaining messages exchanged during
   preparation.

           Figure 2: Overview of the DAP aggregation interaction.

   The number of steps, and the type of the responses, depends on the
   VDAF.  The message structures and processing rules are specified in
   the following subsections.

   In general, reports cannot be aggregated until the Collector
   specifies an aggregation parameter.  However, in some situations it
   is possible to begin aggregation as soon as reports arrive.  For
   example, Prio3 has just one valid aggregation parameter (the empty
   string).

   An aggregation job can be thought of as having three phases:

   *  Initialization: Begin the aggregation flow by disseminating report
      shares and initializing the VDAF prep state for each report.

   *  Continuation: Continue the aggregation flow by exchanging prep
      shares and messages until preparation completes or an error
      occurs.

   *  Completion: Finish the aggregate flow, yielding an output share
      corresponding to each report share in the aggregation job.

   These phases are described in the following subsections.

4.7.1.  Aggregate Initialization

   The Leader begins an aggregation job by choosing a set of candidate
   reports that pertain to the same DAP task and a job ID which MUST be
   unique within the scope of the task.  The job ID is a 16-byte value,
   structured as follows:

   opaque AggregationJobID[16];

   The Leader can run this process for many sets of candidate reports in
   parallel as needed.  After choosing a set of candidates, the Leader
   begins aggregation by splitting each report into report shares, one
   for each Aggregator.  The Leader and Helper then run the aggregate
   initialization flow to accomplish two tasks:

   1.  Recover and determine which input report shares are valid.

   2.  For each valid report share, initialize the VDAF preparation
       process (see Section 5.2 of [VDAF]).

   The Leader and Helper initialization behavior is detailed below.

4.7.1.1.  Leader Initialization

   The Leader begins the aggregate initialization phase with the set of
   candidate reports as follows:

   1.  Generate a fresh AggregationJobID.

   2.  Decrypt the input share for each report share as described in
       Section 4.7.1.3.

   3.  Check that the resulting input share is valid as described in
       Section 4.7.1.4.

   If any step invalidates the report, the Leader rejects the report and
   removes it from the set of candidate reports.

   Next, for each report the Leader executes the following procedure:

   (state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_init(
       vdaf_verify_key,
       agg_param,
       report_id,
       public_share,
       plaintext_input_share.payload)

   where:

   *  vdaf_verify_key is the VDAF verification key for the task

   *  agg_param is the VDAF aggregation parameter provided by the
      Collector (see Section 4.8)

   *  report_id is the report ID, used as the nonce for VDAF sharding

   *  public_share is the report's public share

   *  plaintext_input_share is the Leader's PlaintextInputShare

   The methods are defined in Section 5.8 of [VDAF].  This process
   determines the initial per-report state, as well as the initial
   outbound message to send to the Helper.  If state is of type
   Rejected, then the report is rejected and removed from the set of
   candidate reports, and no message is sent to the Helper.

   If state is of type Continued, then the Leader constructs a
   PrepareInit message structured as follows:

   struct {
     ReportMetadata report_metadata;
     opaque public_share<0..2^32-1>;
     HpkeCiphertext encrypted_input_share;
   } ReportShare;

   struct {
     ReportShare report_share;
     opaque payload<5..2^32-1>;
   } PrepareInit;

   Each of these messages is constructed as follows:

   *  report_share.report_metadata is the report's metadata.

   *  report_share.public_share is the report's public share.

   *  report_share.encrypted_input_share is the intended recipient's
      (i.e.  Helper's) encrypted input share.

   *  payload is set to the outbound message computed by the previous
      step.

   It is not possible for state to be of type Finished during Leader
   initialization.

   Once all the report shares have been initialized, the Leader creates
   an AggregationJobInitReq message structured as follows:

   opaque BatchID[32];

   struct {
     BatchMode batch_mode;
     select (PartialBatchSelector.batch_mode) {
       case time_interval: Empty;
       case leader_selected: BatchID batch_id;
     };
   } PartialBatchSelector;

   struct {
     opaque agg_param<0..2^32-1>;
     PartialBatchSelector part_batch_selector;
     PrepareInit prepare_inits<44..2^32-1>;
   } AggregationJobInitReq;

   This message consists of:

   *  agg_param: The VDAF aggregation parameter.

   *  part_batch_selector: The "partial batch selector" used by the
      Aggregators to determine how to aggregate each report:

      -  For leader-selected tasks, the Leader specifies a "batch ID"
         that determines the batch to which each report for this
         aggregation job belongs.

      The indicated batch mode MUST match the task's batch mode.
      Otherwise, the Helper MUST abort with error invalidMessage.

      This field is called the "partial" batch selector because,
      depending on the batch mode, it may not determine a batch.  In
      particular, if the batch mode is time_interval, the batch is not
      determined until the Collector's query is issued (see
      Section 4.3).

   *  prepare_inits: the sequence of PrepareInit messages constructed in
      the previous step.

   Finally, the Leader sends a PUT request to {helper}/tasks/{task-
   id}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}. The payload is set to
   AggregationJobInitReq and the media type is set to "application/dap-
   aggregation-job-init-req".

   The Leader MUST authenticate its requests to the Helper using a
   scheme that meets the requirements in Section 3.1.

   The Helper's response will be an AggregationJobResp message (see
   Section 4.7.1.2.  The response's prepare_resps must include exactly
   the same report IDs in the same order as the Leader's
   AggregationJobInitReq.  Otherwise, the Leader MUST abort the
   aggregation job.

   [[OPEN ISSUE: consider relaxing this ordering constraint.  See
   issue#217.]]

   Otherwise, the Leader proceeds as follows with each report:

   1.  If the inbound prep response has type "continue", then the Leader
       computes

      (state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_continued(agg_param,
                                                          prev_state,
                                                          inbound)

       where:

       *  agg_param is the VDAF aggregation parameter provided by the
          Collector (see Section 4.8)

       *  prev_state is the state computed earlier by calling
          Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_init or Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_continued

       *  inbound is the message payload in the PrepareResp

       If outbound != None, then the Leader stores state and outbound
       and proceeds to Section 4.7.2.1.  If outbound == None, then the
       preparation process is complete: either state == Rejected(), in
       which case the Leader rejects the report and removes it from the
       candidate set; or state == Finished(out_share), in which case
       preparation is complete and the Leader stores the output share
       for use in the collection interaction Section 4.8.

   2.  Else if the type is "reject", then the Leader rejects the report
       and removes it from the candidate set.  The Leader MUST NOT
       include the report in a subsequent aggregation job, unless the
       error is report_too_early, in which case the Leader MAY include
       the report in a subsequent aggregation job.

   3.  Else the type is invalid, in which case the Leader MUST abort the
       aggregation job.

   (Note: Since VDAF preparation completes in a constant number of
   rounds, it will never be the case that some reports are completed and
   others are not.)

4.7.1.2.  Helper Initialization

   The Helper begins an aggregation job when it receives an
   AggregationJobInitReq message from the Leader.  For each PrepareInit
   conveyed by this message, the Helper attempts to initialize VDAF
   preparation (see Section 5.1 of [VDAF]) just as the Leader does.  If
   successful, it includes the result in its response that the Leader
   will use to continue preparing the report.

   To begin this process, the Helper checks if it recognizes the task
   ID.  If not, then it MUST abort with error unrecognizedTask.

   Next, the Helper checks that the report IDs in
   AggregationJobInitReq.prepare_inits are all distinct.  If two
   preparation initialization messages have the same report ID, then the
   Helper MUST abort with error invalidMessage.

   The Helper is now ready to process each report share into an outbound
   prepare step to return to the Leader.  The responses will be
   structured as follows:

   enum {
     continue(0),
     finished(1)
     reject(2),
     (255)
   } PrepareRespState;

   enum {
     batch_collected(0),
     report_replayed(1),
     report_dropped(2),
     hpke_unknown_config_id(3),
     hpke_decrypt_error(4),
     vdaf_prep_error(5),
     TODO_remove_me(6), /* TODO: replace/remove before RFC. */
     task_expired(7),
     invalid_message(8),
     report_too_early(9),
     (255)
   } PrepareError;

   struct {
     ReportID report_id;
     PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state;
     select (PrepareResp.prepare_resp_state) {
       case continue: opaque payload<5..2^32-1>;
       case finished: Empty;
       case reject:   PrepareError prepare_error;
     };
   } PrepareResp;

   First the Helper preprocesses each report as follows:

   1.  Decrypt the input share for each report share as described in
       Section 4.7.1.3.

   2.  Check that the resulting input share is valid as described in
       Section 4.7.1.4.

   For any report that was rejected, the Helper sets the outbound
   preparation response to

   variant {
     ReportID report_id;
     PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = reject;
     PrepareError prepare_error;
   } PrepareResp;

   where report_id is the report ID and prepare_error is the indicated
   error.  For all other reports it initializes the VDAF prep state as
   follows (let inbound denote the payload of the prep step sent by the
   Leader):

(state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_helper_init(vdaf_verify_key,
                                               agg_param,
                                               report_id,
                                               public_share,
                                               plaintext_input_share.payload)

   where:

   *  vdaf_verify_key is the VDAF verification key for the task

   *  agg_param is the VDAF aggregation parameter sent in the
      AggregationJobInitReq

   *  report_id is the report ID

   *  public_share is the report's public share

   *  plaintext_input_share is the Helper's PlaintextInputShare

   This procedure determines the initial per-report state, as well as
   the initial outbound message to send in response to the Leader.  If
   state is of type Rejected, then the Helper responds with

   variant {
     ReportID report_id;
     PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = reject;
     PrepareError prepare_error = vdaf_prep_error;
   } PrepareResp;

   Otherwise the Helper responds with

   variant {
     ReportID report_id;
     PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = continue;
     opaque payload<5..2^32-1> = outbound;
   } PrepareResp;

   Finally, the Helper creates an AggregationJobResp to send to the
   Leader.  This message is structured as follows:

   struct {
     PrepareResp prepare_resps<26..2^32-1>;
   } AggregationJobResp;

   where prepare_resps are the outbound prep steps computed in the
   previous step.  The order MUST match
   AggregationJobInitReq.prepare_inits.

   The Helper responds to the Leader with HTTP status code 201 Created
   and a body consisting of the AggregationJobResp, with media type
   "application/dap-aggregation-job-resp".

   Changing an aggregation job's parameters is illegal, so further
   requests to PUT /tasks/{tasks}/aggregation_jobs/{aggregation-job-id}
   for the same aggregation-job-id but with a different
   AggregationJobInitReq in the body MUST fail with an HTTP client error
   status code.

   Additionally, it is not possible to rewind or reset the state of an
   aggregation job.  Once an aggregation job has been continued at least
   once (see Section 4.7.2), further requests to initialize that
   aggregation job MUST fail with an HTTP client error status code.

   Finally, if state == Continued(prep_state), then the Helper stores
   state to prepare for the next continuation step (Section 4.7.2.2).
   Otherwise, if state == Finished(out_share), then the Helper stores
   out_share for use in the collection interaction (Section 4.8).

4.7.1.3.  Input Share Decryption

   Each report share has a corresponding task ID, report metadata
   (report ID and, timestamp), public share, and the Aggregator's
   encrypted input share.  Let task_id, report_metadata, public_share,
   and encrypted_input_share denote these values, respectively.  Given
   these values, an Aggregator decrypts the input share as follows.
   First, it constructs an InputShareAad message from task_id,
   report_metadata, and public_share.  Let this be denoted by
   input_share_aad.  Then, the Aggregator looks up the HPKE config and
   corresponding secret key indicated by encrypted_input_share.config_id
   and attempts decryption of the payload with the following procedure:

   plaintext_input_share = OpenBase(encrypted_input_share.enc, sk,
     "dap-11 input share" || 0x01 || server_role,
     input_share_aad, encrypted_input_share.payload)

   where sk is the HPKE secret key, 0x01 represents the Role of the
   sender (always the Client), and server_role is the Role of the
   recipient Aggregator (0x02 for the Leader and 0x03 for the Helper).
   The OpenBase() function is as specified in [HPKE], Section 6.1 for
   the ciphersuite indicated by the HPKE configuration.  If decryption
   fails, the Aggregator marks the report share as invalid with the
   error hpke_decrypt_error.  Otherwise, the Aggregator outputs the
   resulting PlaintextInputShare plaintext_input_share.

4.7.1.4.  Input Share Validation

   Validating an input share will either succeed or fail.  In the case
   of failure, the input share is marked as invalid with a corresponding
   PrepareError.

   Before beginning the preparation step, Aggregators are required to
   perform the following checks:

   1.  Check that the input share can be decoded as specified by the
       VDAF.  If not, the input share MUST be marked as invalid with the
       error invalid_message.

   2.  Check if the report is too far into the future.  Implementors can
       provide for some small leeway, usually no more than a few
       minutes, to account for clock skew.  If a report is rejected for
       this reason, the Aggregator SHOULD mark the input share as
       invalid with the error report_too_early.

   3.  Check if the report's timestamp has passed the task's
       task_expiration time.  If so, the Aggregator MAY mark the input
       share as invalid with the error task_expired.

   4.  Check if the PlaintextInputShare contains unrecognized
       extensions.  If so, the Aggregator MUST mark the input share as
       invalid with error invalid_message.

   5.  Check if the ExtensionType of any two extensions in
       PlaintextInputShare are the same.  If so, the Aggregator MUST
       mark the input share as invalid with error invalid_message.

   6.  Check if the report has been previously aggregated.  If so, the
       input share MUST be marked as invalid with the error
       report_replayed.  A report is considered aggregated if its
       contribution would be included in a relevant collection job.

       *  Implementation note: To detect replay attacks, each Aggregator
          is required to keep track of the set of reports it has
          processed for a given task.  Because honest Clients choose the
          report ID at random, it is sufficient to store the set of IDs
          of processed reports.  However, implementations may find it
          helpful to track additional information, like the timestamp,
          so that the storage used for anti-replay can be sharded
          efficiently.

   7.  If the report pertains to a batch that was previously collected,
       then the input share MUST be marked as invalid with error
       batch_collected.

       *  Implementation note: The Leader considers a batch to be
          collected once it has completed a collection job for a
          CollectionReq message from the Collector; the Helper considers
          a batch to be collected once it has responded to an
          AggregateShareReq message from the Leader.  A batch is
          determined by query (Section 4.3) conveyed in these messages.
          Queries must satisfy the criteria covered in Section 4.8.5.
          These criteria are meant to restrict queries in a way make it
          easy to determine wither a report pertains to a batch that was
          collected.

          [TODO: If a section to clarify report and batch states is
          added this can be removed.  See Issue #384]

   8.  Finally, if an Aggregator cannot determine if an input share is
       valid, it MUST mark the input share as invalid with error
       report_dropped.  For example, if the Aggregator has evicted the
       state required to perform the check from long-term storage.  (See
       Section 5.4.1 for details.)

   If all of the above checks succeed, the input share is not marked as
   invalid.

4.7.2.  Aggregate Continuation

   In the continuation phase, the Leader drives the VDAF preparation of
   each report in the candidate report set until the underlying VDAF
   moves into a terminal state, yielding an output share for both
   Aggregators or a rejection.

   Whether this phase is reached depends on the VDAF: for 1-round VDAFs,
   like Prio3, processing has already completed.  Continuation is
   required for VDAFs that require more than one round.

4.7.2.1.  Leader Continuation

   The Leader begins each step of aggregation continuation with a prep
   state object state and an outbound message outbound for each report
   in the candidate set.

   The Leader advances its aggregation job to the next step (step 1 if
   this is the first continuation after initialization).  Then it
   instructs the Helper to advance the aggregation job to the step the
   Leader has just reached.  For each report the Leader constructs a
   preparation continuation message:

   struct {
     ReportID report_id;
     opaque payload<5..2^32-1>;
   } PrepareContinue;

   where report_id is the report ID associated with state and outbound,
   and payload is set to the outbound message.

   Next, the Leader sends a POST request to the aggregation job URI used
   during initialization (see Section 4.7.1.1) with media type
   "application/dap-aggregation-job-continue-req" and body structured
   as:

   struct {
     uint16 step;
     PrepareContinue prepare_continues<25..2^32-1>;
   } AggregationJobContinueReq;

   The step field is the step of DAP aggregation that the Leader just
   reached and wants the Helper to advance to.  The prepare_continues
   field is the sequence of preparation continuation messages
   constructed in the previous step.  The PrepareContinues MUST be in
   the same order as the previous aggregate request.

   The Leader MUST authenticate its requests to the Helper using a
   scheme that meets the requirements in Section 3.1.

   The Helper's response will be an AggregationJobResp message (see
   Section 4.7.1.2).  The response's prepare_resps must include exactly
   the same report IDs in the same order as the Leader's
   AggregationJobContinueReq.  Otherwise, the Leader MUST abort the
   aggregation job.

   [[OPEN ISSUE: consider relaxing this ordering constraint.  See
   issue#217.]]

   Otherwise, the Leader proceeds as follows with each report:

   1.  If the inbound prep response type is "continue" and the state is
       Continued(prep_state), then the Leader computes

      (state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_leader_continued(agg_param,
                                                          state,
                                                          inbound)

       where inbound is the message payload.  If outbound != None, then
       the Leader stores state and outbound and proceeds to another
       continuation step.  If outbound == None, then the preparation
       process is complete: either state == Rejected(), in which case
       the Leader rejects the report and removes it from the candidate
       set; or state == Finished(out_share), in which case preparation
       is complete and the Leader stores the output share for use in the
       collection interaction Section 4.8.

   2.  Else if the type is "finished" and state == Finished(out_share),
       then preparation is complete and the Leader stores the output
       share for use in the collection flow (Section 4.8).

   3.  Else if the type is "reject", then the Leader rejects the report
       and removes it from the candidate set.

   4.  Else the type is invalid, in which case the Leader MUST abort the
       aggregation job.

4.7.2.2.  Helper Continuation

   The Helper begins each step of continuation with a sequence of state
   objects, which will be Continued(prep_state), one for each report in
   the candidate set.

   The Helper awaits an HTTP POST request to the aggregation job URI
   from the Leader, the body of which is an AggregationJobContinueReq as
   specified in Section 4.7.2.1.

   Next, it checks that it recognizes the task ID.  If not, then it MUST
   abort with error unrecognizedTask.

   Next, it checks if it recognizes the indicated aggregation job ID.
   If not, it MUST abort with error unrecognizedAggregationJob.

   Next, the Helper checks that:

   1.  the report IDs are all distinct

   2.  each report ID corresponds to one of the state objects

   3.  AggregationJobContinueReq.step is not equal to 0

   If any of these checks fail, then the Helper MUST abort with error
   invalidMessage.  Additionally, if any prep step appears out of order
   relative to the previous request, then the Helper MAY abort with
   error invalidMessage.  (Note that a report may be missing, in which
   case the Helper should assume the Leader rejected it.)

   [OPEN ISSUE: Issue 438: It may be useful for the Leader to explicitly
   signal rejection.]

   Next, the Helper checks if the continuation step indicated by the
   request is correct.  (For the first AggregationJobContinueReq the
   value should be 1; for the second the value should be 2; and so on.)
   If the Leader is one step behind (e.g., the Leader has resent the
   previous HTTP request), then the Helper MAY attempt to recover by re-
   sending the previous AggregationJobResp.  In this case it SHOULD
   verify that the contents of the AggregationJobContinueReq are
   identical to the previous message (see Section 4.7.2.3).  Otherwise,
   if the step is incorrect, the Helper MUST abort with error
   stepMismatch.

   The Helper is now ready to continue preparation for each report.  Let
   inbound denote the payload of the prep step.  The Helper computes the
   following:

   (state, outbound) = Vdaf.ping_pong_helper_continued(agg_param,
                                                       state,
                                                       inbound)

   If state == Rejected(), then the Helper's response is

   variant {
     ReportID report_id;
     PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = reject;
     PrepareError prepare_error = vdaf_prep_error;
   } PrepareResp;

   Otherwise, if outbound != None, then the Helper's response is

   variant {
     ReportID report_id;
     PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = continue;
     opaque payload<5..2^32-1> = outbound;
   } PrepareResp;

   Otherwise, if outbound == None, then the Helper's response is

   variant {
     ReportID report_id;
     PrepareRespState prepare_resp_state = finished;
   } PrepareResp;

   Next, the Helper constructs an AggregationJobResp message
   (Section 4.7.1.2) with each prep step.  The order of the prep steps
   MUST match the Leader's request.  It responds to the Leader with HTTP
   status 200 OK, media type application/dap-aggregation-job-resp, and a
   body consisting of the AggregationJobResp.

   Finally, if state == Continued(prep_state), then the Helper stores
   state to prepare for the next continuation step (Section 4.7.2.2).
   Otherwise, if state == Finished(out_share), then the Helper stores
   out_share for use in the collection interaction (Section 4.8).

   If for whatever reason the Leader must abandon the aggregation job,
   it SHOULD send an HTTP DELETE request to the aggregation job URI so
   that the Helper knows it can clean up its state.

4.7.2.3.  Recovering from Aggregation Step Skew

   AggregationJobContinueReq messages contain a step field, allowing
   Aggregators to ensure that their peer is on an expected step of the
   DAP aggregation protocol.  In particular, the intent is to allow
   recovery from a scenario where the Helper successfully advances from
   step n to n+1, but its AggregationJobResp response to the Leader gets
   dropped due to something like a transient network failure.  The
   Leader could then resend the request to have the Helper advance to
   step n+1 and the Helper should be able to retransmit the
   AggregationJobContinueReq that was previously dropped.  To make that
   kind of recovery possible, Aggregator implementations SHOULD
   checkpoint the most recent step's prep state and messages to durable
   storage such that the Leader can re-construct continuation requests
   and the Helper can re-construct continuation responses as needed.

   When implementing an aggregation step skew recovery strategy, the
   Helper SHOULD ensure that the Leader's AggregationJobContinueReq
   message did not change when it was re-sent (i.e., the two messages
   must be identical).  This prevents the Leader from re-winding an
   aggregation job and re-running an aggregation step with different
   parameters.

   [[OPEN ISSUE: Allowing the Leader to "rewind" aggregation job state
   of the Helper may allow an attack on privacy.  For instance, if the
   VDAF verification key changes, the prep shares in the Helper's
   response would change even if the consistency check is made.
   Security analysis is required.  See #401.]]

   One way the Helper could address this would be to store a digest of
   the Leader's request, indexed by aggregation job ID and step, and
   refuse to service a request for a given aggregation step unless it
   matches the previously seen request (if any).

4.8.  Collecting Results

   In this phase, the Collector requests aggregate shares from each
   Aggregator and then locally combines them to yield a single aggregate
   result.  In particular, the Collector issues a query to the Leader
   (Section 4.3), which the Aggregators use to select a batch of reports
   to aggregate.  Each Aggregator emits an aggregate share encrypted to
   the Collector so that it can decrypt and combine them to yield the
   aggregate result.  This entire process is composed of two
   interactions:

   1.  Collect request and response between the Collector and Leader,
       specified in Section 4.8.1

   2.  Aggregate share request and response between the Leader and the
       Helper, specified in Section 4.8.2

   Once complete, the Collector computes the final aggregate result as
   specified in Section 4.8.3.

   This overall process is referred to as a "collection job".

4.8.1.  Collection Job Initialization

   First, the Collector chooses a collection job ID:

   opaque CollectionJobID[16];

   This ID value MUST be unique within the scope of the corresponding
   DAP task.

   To initiate the collection job, the collector issues a PUT request to
   {leader}/tasks/{task-id}/collection_jobs/{collection-job-id}. The
   body of the request has media type "application/dap-collect-req", and
   it is structured as follows:

   struct {
     Query query;
     opaque agg_param<0..2^32-1>; /* VDAF aggregation parameter */
   } CollectionReq;

   The named parameters are:

   *  query, the Collector's query.  The indicated batch mode MUST match
      the task's batch mode.  Otherwise, the Leader MUST abort with
      error "invalidMessage".

   *  agg_param, an aggregation parameter for the VDAF being executed.
      This is the same value as in AggregationJobInitReq (see
      Section 4.7.1.1).

   Collectors MUST authenticate their requests to Leaders using a scheme
   that meets the requirements in Section 3.1.

   Depending on the VDAF scheme and how the Leader is configured, the
   Leader and Helper may already have prepared a sufficient number of
   reports satisfying the query and be ready to return the aggregate
   shares right away.  However, this is not always the case.  In fact,
   for some VDAFs, it is not be possible to begin running aggregation
   jobs (Section 4.7) until the Collector initiates a collection job.
   This is because, in general, the aggregation parameter is not known
   until this point.  In certain situations it is possible to predict
   the aggregation parameter in advance.  For example, for Prio3 the
   only valid aggregation parameter is the empty string.  For these
   reasons, the collection job is handled asynchronously.

   Upon receipt of a CollectionReq, the Leader begins by checking that
   it recognizes the task ID in the request path.  If not, it MUST abort
   with error unrecognizedTask.

   The Leader MAY further validate the request according to the
   requirements in Section 4.8.5 and abort with the indicated error,
   though some conditions such as the number of valid reports may not be
   verifiable while handling the CollectionReq message, and the batch
   will have to be re-validated later on regardless.

   If the Leader finds the CollectionReq to be valid, it immediately
   responds with HTTP status 201.

   The Leader then begins working with the Helper to aggregate the
   reports satisfying the query (or continues this process, depending on
   the VDAF) as described in Section 4.7.

   Changing a collection job's parameters is illegal, so further
   requests to PUT /tasks/{tasks}/collection_jobs/{collection-job-id}
   for the same collection-job-id but with a different CollectionReq in
   the body MUST fail with an HTTP client error status code.

   After receiving the response to its CollectionReq, the Collector
   makes an HTTP GET request to the collection job URI to check on the
   status of the collect job and eventually obtain the result.  If the
   collection job is not finished yet, the Leader responds with HTTP
   status 202 Accepted.  The response MAY include a Retry-After header
   field to suggest a polling interval to the Collector.

   Asynchronously from any request from the Collector, the Leader
   attempts to run the collection job.  It first checks whether it can
   construct a batch for the collection job by applying the requirements
   in Section 4.8.5.  If so, then the Leader obtains the Helper's
   aggregate share following the aggregate-share request flow described
   in Section 4.8.2.  If not, it either aborts the collection job or
   tries again later, depending on which requirement in Section 4.8.5
   was not met.  If the Leader has a pending aggregation job that
   overlaps with the batch and aggregation parameter for the collection
   job, the Leader MUST first complete the aggregation job before
   proceeding and requesting an aggregate share from the Helper.  This
   avoids a race condition between aggregation and collection jobs that
   can yield trivial batch mismatch errors.

   Once both aggregate shares are successfully obtained, the Leader
   responds to subsequent HTTP GET requests to the collection job with
   HTTP status code 200 OK and a body consisting of a Collection:

   struct {
     PartialBatchSelector part_batch_selector;
     uint64 report_count;
     Interval interval;
     HpkeCiphertext leader_encrypted_agg_share;
     HpkeCiphertext helper_encrypted_agg_share;
   } Collection;

   The body's media type is "application/dap-collection".  The
   Collection structure includes the following:

   *  part_batch_selector: Information used to bind the aggregate result
      to the query.  For leader-selected tasks, this includes the batch
      ID assigned to the batch by the Leader.  The indicated batch mode
      MUST match the task's batch mode.

   *  report_count: The number of reports included in the batch.

   *  interval: The smallest interval of time that contains the
      timestamps of all reports included in the batch, such that the
      interval's start and duration are both multiples of the task's
      time_precision parameter.  Note that in the case of a time-
      interval query (see Section 4.3), this interval can be smaller
      than the one in the corresponding CollectionReq.query.

   *  leader_encrypted_agg_share: The Leader's aggregate share,
      encrypted to the Collector.

   *  helper_encrypted_agg_share: The Helper's aggregate share,
      encrypted to the Collector.

   If obtaining aggregate shares fails, then the Leader responds to
   subsequent HTTP GET requests to the collection job with an HTTP error
   status and a problem document as described in Section 3.2.

   The Leader MAY respond with HTTP status 204 No Content to requests to
   a collection job if the results have been deleted.

   The Collector can send an HTTP DELETE request to the collection job,
   which indicates to the Leader that it can abandon the collection job
   and discard all state related to it.

4.8.2.  Obtaining Aggregate Shares

   The Leader must obtain the Helper's encrypted aggregate share before
   it can complete a collection job.  To do this, the Leader first
   computes a checksum over the reports included in the batch.  The
   checksum is computed by taking the SHA256 [SHS] hash of each report
   ID from the Client reports included in the aggregation, then
   combining the hash values with a bitwise-XOR operation.

   Then the Leader sends a POST request to {helper}/tasks/{task-
   id}/aggregate_shares with the following message:

   struct {
     BatchMode batch_mode;
     select (BatchSelector.batch_mode) {
       case time_interval: Interval batch_interval;
       case leader_selected: BatchID batch_id;
     };
   } BatchSelector;

   struct {
     BatchSelector batch_selector;
     opaque agg_param<0..2^32-1>;
     uint64 report_count;
     opaque checksum[32];
   } AggregateShareReq;

   The media type of the request is "application/dap-aggregate-share-
   req".  The message contains the following parameters:

   *  batch_selector: The "batch selector", which encodes parameters
      used to determine the batch being aggregated.  The value depends
      on the batch mode for the task:

      -  For time-interval tasks, the request specifies the batch
         interval.

      -  For leader-selected tasks, the request specifies the batch ID.

      The indicated batch mode MUST match the task's batch mode.
      Otherwise, the Helper MUST abort with "invalidMessage".

   *  agg_param: The opaque aggregation parameter for the VDAF being
      executed.  This value MUST match the AggregationJobInitReq message
      for each aggregation job used to compute the aggregate shares (see
      Section 4.7.1.1) and the aggregation parameter indicated by the
      Collector in the CollectionReq message (see Section 4.8.1).

   *  report_count: The number number of reports included in the batch.

   *  checksum: The batch checksum.

   Leaders MUST authenticate their requests to Helpers using a scheme
   that meets the requirements in Section 3.1.

   To handle the Leader's request, the Helper first ensures that it
   recognizes the task ID in the request path.  If not, it MUST abort
   with error unrecognizedTask.  The Helper then verifies that the
   request meets the requirements for batch parameters following the
   procedure in Section 4.8.5.

   Next, it computes a checksum based on the reports that satisfy the
   query, and checks that the report_count and checksum included in the
   request match its computed values.  If not, then it MUST abort with
   an error of type "batchMismatch".

   Next, it computes the aggregate share agg_share corresponding to the
   set of output shares, denoted out_shares, for the batch interval, as
   follows:

   agg_share = Vdaf.aggregate(agg_param, out_shares)

   Implementation note: For most VDAFs, it is possible to aggregate
   output shares as they arrive rather than wait until the batch is
   collected.  To do so however, it is necessary to enforce the batch
   parameters as described in Section 4.8.5 so that the Aggregator knows
   which aggregate share to update.

   The Helper then encrypts agg_share under the Collector's HPKE public
   key as described in Section 4.8.4, yielding encrypted_agg_share.
   Encryption prevents the Leader from learning the actual result, as it
   only has its own aggregate share and cannot compute the Helper's.

   The Helper responds to the Leader with HTTP status code 200 OK and a
   body consisting of an AggregateShare, with media type "application/
   dap-aggregate-share":

   struct {
     HpkeCiphertext encrypted_aggregate_share;
   } AggregateShare;

   encrypted_aggregate_share.config_id is set to the Collector's HPKE
   config ID. encrypted_aggregate_share.enc is set to the encapsulated
   HPKE context enc computed above and
   encrypted_aggregate_share.ciphertext is the ciphertext
   encrypted_agg_share computed above.

   The Helper's handling of this request MUST be idempotent.  That is,
   if multiple identical, valid AggregateShareReqs are received, they
   should all yield the same response.

   After receiving the Helper's response, the Leader uses the
   HpkeCiphertext to finalize a collection job (see Section 4.8.3).

   Once an AggregateShareReq has been issued for the batch determined by
   a given query, it is an error for the Leader to issue any more
   aggregation jobs for additional reports that satisfy the query.
   These reports will be rejected by the Helper as described in
   Section 4.7.1.4.

   Before completing the collection job, the Leader also computes its
   own aggregate share agg_share by aggregating all of the prepared
   output shares that fall within the batch interval.  Finally, it
   encrypts its aggregate share under the Collector's HPKE public key as
   described in Section 4.8.4.

4.8.3.  Collection Job Finalization

   Once the Collector has received a collection job from the Leader, it
   can decrypt the aggregate shares and produce an aggregate result.
   The Collector decrypts each aggregate share as described in
   Section 4.8.4.  Once the Collector successfully decrypts all
   aggregate shares, it unshards the aggregate shares into an aggregate
   result using the VDAF's unshard algorithm.  In particular, let
   leader_agg_share denote the Leader's aggregate share,
   helper_agg_share denote the Helper's aggregate share, let
   report_count denote the report count sent by the Leader, and let
   agg_param be the opaque aggregation parameter.  The final aggregate
   result is computed as follows:

   agg_result = Vdaf.unshard(agg_param,
                             [leader_agg_share, helper_agg_share],
                             report_count)

4.8.4.  Aggregate Share Encryption

   Encrypting an aggregate share agg_share for a given AggregateShareReq
   is done as follows:

enc, payload = SealBase(pk, "dap-11 aggregate share" || server_role || 0x00,
  agg_share_aad, agg_share)

   where pk is the HPKE public key encoded by the Collector's HPKE key,
   server_role is the Role of the encrypting server (0x02 for the Leader
   and 0x03 for a Helper), 0x00 represents the Role of the recipient
   (always the Collector), and agg_share_aad is a value of type
   AggregateShareAad.  The SealBase() function is as specified in
   [HPKE], Section 6.1 for the ciphersuite indicated by the HPKE
   configuration.

   struct {
     TaskID task_id;
     opaque agg_param<0..2^32-1>;
     BatchSelector batch_selector;
   } AggregateShareAad;

   *  task_id is the ID of the task the aggregate share was computed in.

   *  agg_param is the aggregation parameter used to compute the
      aggregate share.

   *  batch_selector is the is the batch selector from the
      AggregateShareReq (for the Helper) or the batch selector computed
      from the Collector's query (for the Leader).

   The Collector decrypts these aggregate shares using the opposite
   process.  Specifically, given an encrypted input share, denoted
   enc_share, for a given batch selector, decryption works as follows:

   agg_share = OpenBase(enc_share.enc, sk, "dap-11 aggregate share" ||
     server_role || 0x00, agg_share_aad, enc_share.payload)

   where sk is the HPKE secret key, server_role is the Role of the
   server that sent the aggregate share (0x02 for the Leader and 0x03
   for the Helper), 0x00 represents the Role of the recipient (always
   the Collector), and agg_share_aad is an AggregateShareAad message
   constructed from the task ID and the aggregation parameter in the
   collect request, and a batch selector.  The value of the batch
   selector used in agg_share_aad is computed by the Collector from its
   query and the response to its query as follows:

   *  For time-interval tasks, the batch selector is the batch interval
      specified in the query.

   *  For leader-selected tasks, the batch selector is the batch ID sent
      in the response.

   The OpenBase() function is as specified in [HPKE], Section 6.1 for
   the ciphersuite indicated by the HPKE configuration.

4.8.5.  Batch Validation

   Before a Leader runs a collection job or a Helper responds to an
   AggregateShareReq, it must first check that the job or request does
   not violate the parameters associated with the DAP task.  It does so
   as described here.  Where we say that an Aggregator MUST abort with
   some error, then:

   *  Leaders should respond to subsequent HTTP GET requests to the
      collection job with the indicated error.

   *  Helpers should respond to the AggregateShareReq with the indicated
      error.

   First the Aggregator checks that the batch respects any "boundaries"
   determined by the batch mode.  These are described in the subsections
   below.  If the boundary check fails, then the Aggregator MUST abort
   with an error of type "batchInvalid".

   Next, the Aggregator checks that batch contains a valid number of
   reports, as determined by the batch mode.  If the size check fails,
   then Helpers MUST abort with an error of type "invalidBatchSize".
   Leaders SHOULD wait for more reports to be validated and try the
   collection job again later.

   Next, the Aggregator checks that the batch has not been queried with
   multiple distinct aggregation parameters.  If the batch has been
   queried with more than one distinct aggregation parameter, the
   Aggregator MUST abort with error of type "batchQueriedMultipleTimes".

   Finally, the Aggregator checks that the batch does not contain a
   report that was included in any previous batch.  If this batch
   overlap check fails, then the Aggregator MUST abort with error of
   type "batchOverlap".  For time-interval tasks, it is sufficient (but
   not necessary) to check that the batch interval does not overlap with
   the batch interval of any previous query.  If this batch interval
   check fails, then the Aggregator MAY abort with error of type
   "batchOverlap".

   [[OPEN ISSUE: #195 tracks how we might relax this constraint to allow
   for more collect query flexibility.  As of now, this is quite rigid
   and doesn't give the Collector much room for mistakes.]]

4.8.5.1.  Time-interval Batch Mode

4.8.5.1.1.  Boundary Check

   The batch boundaries are determined by the time_precision field of
   the task configuration.  For the batch_interval included with the
   query, the Aggregator checks that:

   *  batch_interval.duration >= time_precision (this field determines,
      effectively, the minimum batch duration)

   *  both batch_interval.start and batch_interval.duration are
      divisible by time_precision

   These measures ensure that Aggregators can efficiently "pre-
   aggregate" output shares recovered during the aggregation
   interaction.

4.8.5.1.2.  Size Check

   The query configuration specifies the minimum batch size,
   min_batch_size.  The Aggregator checks that len(X) >= min_batch_size,
   where X is the set of reports successfully aggregated into the batch.

4.8.5.2.  Leader-selected Batch Mode

4.8.5.2.1.  Boundary Check

   The batch boundaries are defined by opaque batch IDs.  Thus the
   Aggregator needs to check that the query is associated with a known
   batch ID; specifically, for an AggregateShareReq, the Helper checks
   that the batch ID provided by the Leader corresponds to a batch ID
   used in a previous AggregationJobInitReq for the task.

4.8.5.2.2.  Size Check

   The query configuration specifies the minimum batch size,
   min_batch_size.  The Aggregator checks that len(X) >= min_batch_size,
   where X is the set of reports successfully aggregated into the batch.

5.  Operational Considerations

   The DAP protocol has inherent constraints derived from the tradeoff
   between privacy guarantees and computational complexity.  These
   tradeoffs influence how applications may choose to utilize services
   implementing the specification.

5.1.  Protocol Participant Capabilities

   The design in this document has different assumptions and
   requirements for different protocol participants, including Clients,
   Aggregators, and Collectors.  This section describes these
   capabilities in more detail.

5.1.1.  Client Capabilities

   Clients have limited capabilities and requirements.  Their only
   inputs to the protocol are (1) the parameters configured out of band
   and (2) a measurement.  Clients are not expected to store any state
   across any upload flows, nor are they required to implement any sort
   of report upload retry mechanism.  By design, the protocol in this
   document is robust against individual Client upload failures since
   the protocol output is an aggregate over all inputs.

5.1.2.  Aggregator Capabilities

   Leaders and Helpers have different operational requirements.  The
   design in this document assumes an operationally competent Leader,
   i.e., one that has no storage or computation limitations or
   constraints, but only a modestly provisioned Helper, i.e., one that
   has computation, bandwidth, and storage constraints.  By design,
   Leaders must be at least as capable as Helpers, where Helpers are
   generally required to:

   *  Support the aggregate interaction, which includes validating and
      aggregating reports; and

   *  Publish and manage an HPKE configuration that can be used for the
      upload protocol.

   In addition, for each DAP task, the Helper is required to:

   *  Implement some form of batch-to-report index, as well as inter-
      and intra-batch replay mitigation storage, which includes some way
      of tracking batch report size.  Some of this state may be used for
      replay attack mitigation.  The replay mitigation strategy is
      described in Section 4.7.1.4.

   Beyond the minimal capabilities required of Helpers, Leaders are
   generally required to:

   *  Support the upload protocol and store reports; and

   *  Track batch report size during each collect flow and request
      encrypted output shares from Helpers.

   In addition, for each DAP task, the Leader is required to:

   *  Implement and store state for the form of inter- and intra-batch
      replay mitigation in Section 4.7.1.4.

5.1.3.  Collector Capabilities

   Collectors statefully interact with Aggregators to produce an
   aggregate output.  Their input to the protocol is the task
   parameters, configured out of band, which include the corresponding
   batch window and size.  For each collect invocation, Collectors are
   required to keep state from the start of the protocol to the end as
   needed to produce the final aggregate output.

   Collectors must also maintain state for the lifetime of each task,
   which includes key material associated with the HPKE key
   configuration.

5.2.  VDAFs and Compute Requirements

   The choice of VDAF can impact the computation required for a DAP
   task.  For instance, the Prio3SumVec VDAF [VDAF] requires each
   measurement to be vectors of the same length, which all parties need
   to agree on prior to VDAF execution.  The computation required for
   such tasks increases linearly as a function of the chosen length, as
   each vector element must be processed in turn.

   Therefore, care must be taken that a DAP deployment can handle VDAF
   execution of all possible VDAF configurations for any tasks which the
   deployment may be configured for.  Otherwise, an attacker may deny
   service by uploading many expensive reports to a suitably-configured
   VDAF.

   Applications which require computationally-expensive VDAFs can
   mitigate the computation cost of aggregation in a few ways, such as
   producing aggregates over a sample of the data or choosing a
   representation of the data permitting a simpler aggregation scheme.

   [[TODO: Discuss explicit key performance indicators, here or
   elsewhere.]]

5.3.  Aggregation Utility and Soft Batch Deadlines

   A soft real-time system should produce a response within a deadline
   to be useful.  This constraint may be relevant when the value of an
   aggregate decreases over time.  A missed deadline can reduce an
   aggregate's utility but not necessarily cause failure in the system.

   An example of a soft real-time constraint is the expectation that
   input data can be verified and aggregated in a period equal to data
   collection, given some computational budget.  Meeting these deadlines
   will require efficient implementations of the input-validation
   protocol.  Applications might batch requests or utilize more
   efficient serialization to improve throughput.

   Some applications may be constrained by the time that it takes to
   reach a privacy threshold defined by a minimum number of reports.
   One possible solution is to increase the reporting period so more
   samples can be collected, balanced against the urgency of responding
   to a soft deadline.

5.4.  Protocol-specific Optimizations

   Not all DAP tasks have the same operational requirements, so the
   protocol is designed to allow implementations to reduce operational
   costs in certain cases.

5.4.1.  Reducing Storage Requirements

   In general, the Aggregators are required to keep state for tasks and
   all valid reports for as long as collection requests can be made for
   them.  However, it is not necessary to store the complete reports.
   Each Aggregator only needs to store an aggregate share for each
   possible batch interval (for time-interval) or batch ID (for leader-
   selected), along with a flag indicating whether the aggregate share
   has been collected.  This is due to the requirement that in the time-
   interval case, the batch interval respect the boundaries defined by
   the DAP parameters; and that in leader-selected case, a batch is
   determined entirely by a batch ID.  (See Section 4.8.5.)

   However, Aggregators are also required to implement several per-
   report checks that require retaining a number of data artifacts.  For
   example, to detect replay attacks, it is necessary for each
   Aggregator to retain the set of report IDs of reports that have been
   aggregated for the task so far.  Depending on the task lifetime and
   report upload rate, this can result in high storage costs.  To
   alleviate this burden, DAP allows Aggregators to drop this state as
   needed, so long as reports are dropped properly as described in
   Section 4.7.1.4.  Aggregators SHOULD take steps to mitigate the risk
   of dropping reports (e.g., by evicting the oldest data first).

   Furthermore, the Aggregators must store data related to a task as
   long as the current time has not passed this task's task_expiration.
   Aggregator MAY delete the task and all data pertaining to this task
   after task_expiration.  Implementors SHOULD provide for some leeway
   so the Collector can collect the batch after some delay.

6.  Compliance Requirements

   In the absence of an application or deployment-specific profile
   specifying otherwise, a compliant DAP application MUST implement the
   following HPKE cipher suite:

   *  KEM: DHKEM(X25519, HKDF-SHA256) (see [HPKE], Section 7.1)

   *  KDF: HKDF-SHA256 (see [HPKE], Section 7.2)

   *  AEAD: AES-128-GCM (see [HPKE], Section 7.3)

7.  Security Considerations

   DAP aims to achieve the privacy and robustness security goals defined
   in Section 9 of [VDAF], even in the presence of an active attacker.
   It is assumed that the attacker may control the network and have the
   ability to control a subset of of Clients, one of the Aggregators,
   and the Collector for a given task.

   In the presence of this adversary, there are some threats DAP does
   not defend against and which are considered outside of DAP's threat
   model.  These are enumerated below, along with potential mitigations.

   Attacks on robustness:

   1.  Aggregators can defeat robustness by emitting incorrect aggregate
       shares, by omitting reports from the aggregation process, or by
       manipulating the VDAF preparation process for a single report.
       DAP follows VDAF in providing robustness only if both Aggregators
       honestly follow the protocol.

   2.  Clients may affect the quality of aggregate results by reporting
       false measurements.  A VDAF can only verify that a submitted
       measurement is valid, not that it is true.

   3.  An attacker can impersonate multiple Clients, or a single
       malicious Client can upload an unexpectedly-large number of
       reports, in order to skew aggregate results or to reduce the
       number of measurements from honest Clients in a batch below the
       minimum batch size.  See Section 7.1 for discussion and potential
       mitigations.

   Attacks on privacy:

   1.  Clients can intentionally leak their own measurements and
       compromise their own privacy.

   2.  Both Aggregators together can, purposefully or accidentally,
       share unencrypted input shares in order to defeat the privacy of
       individual reports.  DAP follows VDAF in providing privacy only
       if at least one Aggregator honestly follows the protocol.

   Attacks on other properties of the system:

   1.  Both Aggregators together can, purposefully or accidentally,
       share unencrypted aggregate shares in order to reveal the
       aggregation result for a given batch.

   2.  Aggregators, or a passive network attacker between the Clients
       and the Leader, can examine metadata such as HTTP client IP in
       order to infer which Clients are submitting reports.  Depending
       on the particulars of the deployment, this may be used to infer
       sensitive information about the Client.  This can be mitigated
       for the Aggregator by deploying an anonymizing proxy (see
       Section 7.4), or in general by requiring Clients to submit
       reports at regular intervals independently of the measurement
       value such that the existence of a report does not imply the
       occurrence of a sensitive event.

   3.  Aggregators can deny service by refusing to respond to collection
       requests or aggregate share requests.

   4.  Some VDAFs could leak information to either Aggregator or the
       Collector beyond what the protocol intended to learn.  It may be
       possible to mitigate such leakages using differential privacy
       (Section 7.5).

7.1.  Sybil Attacks

   Several attacks on privacy or robustness involve malicious Clients
   uploading reports that are valid under the chosen VDAF but incorrect.

   For example, a DAP deployment might be measuring the heights of a
   human population and configure a variant of Prio3 to prove that
   measurements are values in the range of 80-250 cm.  A malicious
   Client would not be able to claim a height of 400 cm, but they could
   submit multiple bogus reports inside the acceptable range, which
   would yield incorrect averages.  More generally, DAP deployments are
   susceptible to Sybil attacks [Dou02], especially when carried out by
   the Leader.

   In this type of attack, the adversary adds to a batch a number of
   reports that skew the aggregate result in its favor.  For example,
   sending known measurements to the Aggregators can allow a Collector
   to shrink the effective anonymity set by subtracting the known
   measurements from the aggregate result.  The result may reveal
   additional information about the honest measurements, leading to a
   privacy violation; or the result may have some property that is
   desirable to the adversary ("stats poisoning").

   Depending on the deployment and the specific threat being mitigated,
   there are different ways to address Sybil attacks, such as:

   1.  Implementing Client authentication, as described in Section 7.3,
       likely paired with rate-limiting uploads from individual Clients.

   2.  Removing Client-specific metadata on individual reports, such as
       through the use of anonymizing proxies in the upload flow, as
       described in Section 7.4.

   3.  Differential privacy (Section 7.5) can help mitigate Sybil
       attacks to some extent.

7.2.  Batch-selection Attacks

   Depending on the batch mode, the privacy of an individual Client may
   be infringed upon by selection of the batch.  For example, in the
   leader-selected batch mode, the Leader is free to select the reports
   that compose a given batch almost arbitrarily; a malicious Leader
   might choose a batch composed of reports arriving from a single
   client.  The aggregate derived from this batch might then reveal
   information about that Client.

   The mitigations for this attack are similar to those used for Sybil
   attacks (Section 7.1):

   1.  Implementing Client authentication, as described in Section 7.3,
       and having each aggregator verify that each batch contains
       reports from a suitable number of distinct clients.

   2.  Disassociating each report from the Client which generated it,
       via the use of anonymizing proxies (Section 7.4) or similar
       techniques.

   3.  Differential privacy (Section 7.5) can help mitigate the impact
       of this attack.

   4.  Deployment-specific mitigations may also be possible: for
       example, if every Client is sending reports at a given rate, it
       may be possible for aggregators to bound the accepted age of
       reports such that the number of aggregatable reports from a given
       Client is small enough to effectively mitigate this attack.

7.3.  Client Authentication

   In settings where it is practical for each Client to have an identity
   provisioned (e.g., a user logged into a backend service or a hardware
   device programmed with an identity), Client authentication can help
   Aggregators (or an authenticating proxy deployed between Clients and
   the Aggregators; see Section 7.4) ensure that all reports come from
   authentic Clients.  Note that because the Helper never handles
   messages directly from the Clients, reports would need to include an
   extension (Section 4.6.3) to convey authentication information to the
   Helper.  For example, a deployment might include a Privacy Pass token
   ([I-D.draft-ietf-privacypass-architecture-16]) in an extension to
   allow both Aggregators to independently verify the Client's identity.

   However, in some deployments, it will not be practical to require
   Clients to authenticate, so Client authentication is not mandatory in
   DAP.  For example, a widely distributed application that does not
   require its users to log in to any service has no obvious way to
   authenticate its report uploads.

7.4.  Anonymizing Proxies

   Client reports can contain auxiliary information such as source IP,
   HTTP user agent, or Client authentication information (in deployments
   which use it, see Section 7.3).  This metadata can be used by
   Aggregators to identify participating Clients or permit some attacks
   on robustness.  This auxiliary information can be removed by having
   Clients submit reports to an anonymizing proxy server which would
   then use Oblivious HTTP [RFC9458] to forward reports to the DAP
   Leader.  In this scenario, Client authentication would be performed
   by the proxy rather than any of the participants in the DAP protocol.

7.5.  Differential Privacy

   DAP deployments can choose to ensure their aggregate results achieve
   differential privacy ([Vad16]).  A simple approach would require the
   Aggregators to add two-sided noise (e.g. sampled from a two-sided
   geometric distribution) to aggregate shares.  Since each Aggregator
   is adding noise independently, privacy can be guaranteed even if all
   but one of the Aggregators is malicious.  Differential privacy is a
   strong privacy definition, and protects users in extreme
   circumstances: even if an adversary has prior knowledge of every
   measurement in a batch except for one, that one measurement is still
   formally protected.

7.6.  Task Parameters

   Distribution of DAP task parameters is out of band from DAP itself
   and thus not discussed in this document.  This section examines the
   security tradeoffs involved in the selection of the DAP task
   parameters.  Generally, attacks involving crafted DAP task parameters
   can be mitigated by having the Aggregators refuse shared parameters
   that are trivially insecure (e.g., a minimum batch size of 1 report).

7.6.1.  VDAF Verification Key Requirements

   Knowledge of the verification key would allow a Client to forge a
   report with invalid values that will nevertheless pass verification.
   Therefore, the verification key must be kept secret from Clients.

   Furthermore, for a given report, it may be possible to craft a
   verification key which leaks information about that report's
   measurement during VDAF preparation.  Therefore, the verification key
   for a task SHOULD be chosen before any reports are generated.
   Moreover, it SHOULD be fixed for the lifetime of the task and not be
   rotated.  One way to ensure that the verification key is generated
   independently from any given report is to derive the key based on the
   task ID and some previously agreed upon secret (verify_key_seed)
   between Aggregators, as follows:

   verify_key = HKDF-Expand(
       HKDF-Extract(
           "verify_key",    # salt
           verify_key_seed, # IKM
       ),
       task_id,             # info
       VERIFY_KEY_SIZE,     # L
   )

   Here, VERIFY_KEY_SIZE is the length of the verification key, and
   HKDF-Extract and HKDF-Expand are as defined in [RFC5869].

   This requirement comes from current security analysis for existing
   VDAFs.  In particular, the security proofs for Prio3 require that the
   verification key is chosen independently of the generated reports.

7.6.2.  Batch Parameters

   An important parameter of a DAP deployment is the minimum batch size.
   If a batch includes too few reports, then the aggregate result can
   reveal information about individual measurements.  Aggregators
   enforce the agreed-upon minimum batch size during the collection
   protocol, but implementations SHOULD also opt out of participating in
   a DAP task if the minimum batch size is too small.  This document
   does not specify how to choose an appropriate minimum batch size, but
   an appropriate value may be determined from the differential privacy
   (Section 7.5) parameters in use, if any.

7.6.3.  Task Configuration Agreement and Consistency

   In order to execute a DAP task, it is necessary for all parties to
   ensure they agree on the configuration of the task.  However, it is
   possible for a party to participate in the execution of DAP without
   knowing all of the task's parameters.  For example, a Client can
   upload a report (Section 4.6) without knowing the minimum batch size
   that is enforced by the Aggregators during collection (Section 4.8).

   Depending on the deployment model, agreement can require that task
   parameters are visible to all parties such that each party can choose
   whether to participate based on the value of any parameter.  This
   includes the parameters enumerated in Section 4.4 and any additional
   parameters implied by upload extensions Section 4.6.3 used by the
   task.  Since meaningful privacy requires that multiple Clients
   contribute to a task, they should also share a consistent view of the
   task configuration.

7.7.  Infrastructure Diversity

   DAP deployments should ensure that Aggregators do not have common
   dependencies that would enable a single vendor to reassemble
   measurements.  For example, if all participating Aggregators stored
   unencrypted input shares on the same cloud object storage service,
   then that cloud vendor would be able to reassemble all the input
   shares and defeat privacy.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Protocol Message Media Types

   This specification defines the following protocol messages, along
   with their corresponding media types types:

   *  HpkeConfigList Section 4.6.1: "application/dap-hpke-config-list"

   *  Report Section 4.6.2: "application/dap-report"

   *  AggregationJobInitReq Section 4.7.1.1: "application/dap-
      aggregation-job-init-req"

   *  AggregationJobResp Section 4.7.1.2: "application/dap-aggregation-
      job-resp"

   *  AggregationJobContinueReq Section 4.7.2.1: "application/dap-
      aggregation-job-continue-req"

   *  AggregateShareReq Section 4.8: "application/dap-aggregate-share-
      req"

   *  AggregateShare Section 4.8: "application/dap-aggregate-share"

   *  CollectionReq Section 4.8: "application/dap-collect-req"

   *  Collection Section 4.8: "application/dap-collection"

   The definition for each media type is in the following subsections.

   Protocol message format evolution is supported through the definition
   of new formats that are identified by new media types.

   IANA [shall update / has updated] the "Media Types" registry at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types with the registration
   information in this section for all media types listed above.

   [OPEN ISSUE: Solicit review of these allocations from domain
   experts.]

8.1.1.  Message versioning

   Media types for the HTTP requests are specific to this version of
   DAP.  When a new major enhancement is proposed that results in newer
   IETF specification for DAP, a new set of media types need to be
   defined.  In other words, newer versions of DAP will not be backward
   compatible with this version of DAP.

   (NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: Remove this paragraph.)  HTTP requests with DAP
   media types MAY express an optional parameter 'version', following
   Section 8.3 of [RFC9110].  Value of this parameter indicates current
   draft version of the protocol the component is using.  This MAY be
   used as a hint by the receiver of the request to do compatibility
   checks between client and server.  For example, A report submission
   to leader from a client that supports draft-ietf-ppm-dap-09 could
   have the header Media-Type: application/dap-report;version=09.
